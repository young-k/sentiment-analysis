Last year was going extremely well. Then, I went through 2 relationships where I got unfairly dumped on that put my head in a blender and hit a wave of legal trouble.

I've never had to deal with every waking moment being excruciating. I also, for the first time, had subtle thoughts of suicide creep in which was immensely soul crippling. The accommodating despair that followed was on a level that I had never experienced. I thought my time on this blue globe spinning in the vastness of space was coming to an end. I couldn't possibly go on for much longer. But something else happened. I noticed the things that I did have. I had a family that was supportive, despite the occasional bickering. I had friends that, while usually on the side watching helplessly when I'm going thru it because I'm so stoic, were slowly moving in as they saw me decline. I notice the beautiful little things in life that I ignored up until now. I have a million opportunities still coming my way; and despite being beat down, I found out that I wasn't broken. I just hit the bottom, where I'd never been before, and it made me swear that I would do everything in my power to get out and never come back. A mindset that I did not have before. If you are reading this, I'm assuming you can relate. I just want to tell you not to give up, even though it seems hopeless. Hitting rock bottom made me realize what I had actually been missing out on, and I am happy that at least things are clear to me now. Cleaning up the mess isn't fun, but the strongest souls weren't born that way, they were made through despair and suffering. Through fighting their way out of the woods, machete and boots, when they realized that they were strong enough to fight for the lives they want. We are all more than strong enough. It's just hard to believe sometimes. Especially when the blows keep coming. But if we keep fighting, we are guaranteed to win.

And I got out of depression and ever since then I try to help people who feel the same because I \"think\" I know how it feels, but at times people get offended when I say try to think of it as an emotion so before I offend someone else I want to know if it truly is an illness or a emotion? \nIf am honest I consider my self a severe hedonist nothing but pleasure motivates me in life at this point and I wont lie helping depressed or atleast trying to feels like the one thing that doesn't give me pleasure but I sure ass hell dont mind doing it because I can \"relate\".

You know a lot of facts, but you haven\u2019t learned how to put them together into a coherent whole. \n\nFirst off, bipolar is completely different from depression. Just because people go through depressed states does not mean they are even remotely the same. Bipolar is largely thought to be an issue where people\u2019s cell gates don\u2019t work quite right, so the chemicals going between them aren\u2019t as well regulated as they should be. That is COMPLETELY different from how unipolar depression works. \n\nSecondly, major depression and treatment resistant depression are the same thing, just different levels of severity. \n\nThirdly, there is clinical, peer-reviewed, evidence spanning decades (I want to say going back to the 1970s, but don\u2019t quote me on that) showing that people with depression often have low levels of serotonin. Some brave souls had spinal taps done to confirm this, and I thank them for that sacrifice. This is why SSRI\u2019s (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are typically the first thing prescribed for depression. It prevents the body from breaking down serotonin as quickly, thus you have more of it in your brain and people tend to feel better. The FDA wouldn\u2019t approve the drugs if the drug companies couldn\u2019t show that they worked better than a placebo. \n\nFinally, I\u2019m not sure what diagnostic criteria has to do with the two very broad types of depression. I\u2019m guessing it was an attempt to sound authoritative and you were hoping I knew even less than you so it would go unchallenged, but feel free to fill us in on the actual reason. I gave two very broad types of depression, which everyone seemed to understand except you. Yes, I overgeneralized things, but I was only intending to give a 30,000ft overview. Again, everyone but you seems to have figured this out. \n\nI applaud your efforts to learn, but maybe wait a while until you\u2019ve had time to process that information. Also, maybe lay off the conspiracy theory talk. Yes, drug companies charge a lot of money for pills they can manufacture for dirt cheap, but they spent a LOT of money developing, testing, and getting the drug approved by the FDA. We\u2019re talking probably tens of millions of dollars. And for every successful new drug, there were probably 5-6 others that didn\u2019t pan out. Do they still gouge people? Probably, but it\u2019s not by as much as you might think.

You can\u2019t just read the DSM V criteria and think you know how to diagnose someone with depression. \n\nLet\u2019s just start over here...\n\nThe OP asked if depression was a mood disorder or a thought disorder. The answer is it can be both. Some people get depressed because a loved one died and maybe get stuck in the grieving process. Some people obsess over what they think is missing from their lives. For example, someone who thinks that if only they could find a girlfriend, their life would instantly be better. These will not be helped by medications at all, you need CBT/DBT to help work through things. They also tend to be transitory. Once you understand what the issue is, you can move on. \n\nThe other cause for depression is that your body does not produce enough of certain neurotransmitters. There\u2019s no known way (yet at least, but with gene editing who knows about 5-10 years from now) to make your brain produce more or these chemicals. All you can really do is try to keep your body from breaking it down as quickly. This sort of depression responds best to a combination of medication and therapy... pills and skills as it is sometimes called. There are also other therapies like TMS that show some promise. \n\nIn your zeal to try and act like you know more than you do, you made a bunch of incorrect assumptions about my first post.

During recess, I began to tie the slip knot on the monkey bars using jump rope. I feel like I only vaguely knew of what I was doing. But it felt right. I think I even wrapped it around my neck at some point. I was stopped by the teachers aide. She asked me what I was doing. I lied. I guess I was smart enough to know that if I told the truth I\u2019d have to deal with my parents. And my parents were freshly divorced. My baby brother was just born a year before and my little sister was 2. So I guess I didn\u2019t want to add anything \u2018extra\u2019 to their plates. Before the divorce my life seemed good. Besides being whooped almost everyday (I\u2019m the oldest) and my parents fighting a lot, there was lots of love... but once my Dad wasn\u2019t in the house (mom got primary custody of us) I had to step up. And I wouldn\u2019t be the same little boy full of life since that moment. From that point on I used every escape I could to ease the discomfort of my situation. It started with video games. I would spend all my free time playing my Xbox, Wii, or WoW until I fell asleep. The only time I did anything else was when I was \u2018forced\u2019 to go outside or join a sport or program by my Mom. And I did have a good time when that happened. But my Dad was depressed too, so we\u2019d \u2018bond\u2019 over our escapism, whenever I\u2019d see him. When I was 12, I got into weed and alcohol. It very quickly got to the point where that was all I\u2019d do. I went from being an average student, to straight D\u2019s and F\u2019s. But I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t give a fuck about anything. I barely graduated from middle school. I took my pain out on my brother and sister. I abused and neglected them when I was left home alone to watch them because I felt like they had to feel what I felt since their lives were \u201ctoo easy\u201d. There were good moments. Where I was happy. Where my siblings and I got along. Where my Mom and us would all do something as a family. Or when I\u2019d do something fun with my Dad besides watch him get high and stare at a computer screen. But when I look back at it, those moments seemed very far and few in between. I remember starting to get seriously depressed in the beginning of high school. I didn\u2019t go to school for over a month and stopped smoking weed to cope. I would just stay in bed all day. Waiting. Crying. Sleeping. Only getting up to do basic things like taking a shit or drinking water. I wanted my life to be over but I didn\u2019t wanna do that to my Mom. I didn\u2019t want her sacrifices to be all for nothing. My Mom was so busy providing for us I don\u2019t think she even really noticed... since she was either at school or working. I guess I \u2018snapped out of it\u2019 when I went to visit my Dad and Grandma. My Dad had a bag of kief and gave me a bong hit to make me \u2018feel better\u2019. It\u2019s like all my sadness was washed away after a coughing fit and I cracked a smile for the first time in over a month. But this just led me to abusing weed and drugs in a new way. I don\u2019t even think I was aware I was using drugs to cope at first but after that moment I \u2018needed\u2019 to be high. I soon lost all my good friends. I isolated myself from everyone who I couldn\u2019t get high with. I didn\u2019t finish high school (but got a ged) or have a \u2018senior year\u2019 or goto a university. And I started to feel even more like a shell of a person I once was. Like wasted potential. And when my cousin (who was like a brother) died from gun violence it made me even more isolated and depressed. I felt like he was one of the only people left on this planet that understood me. But when I was 19, I met a woman who I thought was my soulmate. She had come from a broken home too and I thought we were perfect for each other since we had similar experiences. But for the 3 years we were together, our relationship was a rollercoaster ride of codependency, I wasn\u2019t ready for. When we were happy we were flying. But when we fought it was hell. However, I still loved her because that\u2019s what I thought love was. I knew this relationship wasn\u2019t good for me after our first big fight, but I couldn\u2019t let her go. I thought we could help each other, through love. We did everything we could to stay together and get through whatever problems we\u2019d have. Even neglecting advice from the few family members and friends we had, to stop what we were doing. We would get drunk/high together almost everyday with anything we could get our hands on. And for the entirety of our relationship that was life for us. The last time I saw her, she had run out of our apartment into the night\u2019s rain screaming for help. We had been drinking. It started with an argument that led to us breaking up, which led to her going into the bathroom with a knife to \u2018kill herself\u2019. She\u2019d threatened suicide before, but this time was different. I lost it. I got into the bathroom and tackled her and the knife out of her hand. I overpowered her and hurt her. I pressed a sheathed sword to her stomach and told her to \u201cget lost\u201d and \u201cif anyone was gonna kill you it\u2019d be me\u201d.  Guess I just wanted her to realize she didn\u2019t want to die as much as she thought she wanted to. I wanted to scare her. It worked. I went outside after her and there was police. I was arrested and sent to jail for a few days. I was facing a felony charge and if it wasn\u2019t for my lies and my lawyer I\u2019d still be behind bars. I\u2019ve stopped abusing weed and drugs and it feels so bittersweet. I can no longer contact her in any way without the threat of jail time. But I still miss and love her with all my heart... I know she\u2019ll be better off without me in her life though. The last thing she told me was how I wasted 3 years of her life and how I\u2019m a \u2018bum ass nigga\u2019. I\u2019m a monster.I didn\u2019t start off this way but I don\u2019t know how to get better. I don\u2019t think any amount of medication or therapy can help me. It\u2019s nearly impossible for me to look at myself in a mirror or even smile a fake smile.The only reason I haven\u2019t killed myself yet is because I don\u2019t want my family to suffer. My family still hasn\u2019t been the same after my cousins death and I don\u2019t want them to feel pain for mines. But part of me thinks that if they really knew who I am, they wouldn\u2019t care. Or neither would anyone reading this. Now as I\u2019m writing this, no one talks to me or reaches out to me, unless I reach out first. All my friends are \u2018dead\u2019 or fake. The only girl who ever truly loved me wants nothing to do with me. My brother, sister, and Dad don\u2019t seem to want anything to do with me. And I feel like my Mom\u2019s just here for me out of pity. So if I die, I wanna go to hell. Cause I\u2019m a piece of shit, it ain\u2019t hard to fucking tell.

But I learned a lot more about myself. And with every passing day the knowledge about myself, about how lonely I am becoming and how alone I feel in this world is just crushing me. It is almost too much to bear. Almost. It feels as if I am at the edge of a cliff and it is taking all the strength I have to keep me from falling over. I knew I was depressed for a long time now.

But for me it was always me at the edge of the cliff holding onto dear life. Or maybe I just never had to courage to let go of it.I had a dream last night. Some might call it a nightmare and oh how I envy them. Because well who would call dying a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night. I still remember it, clear as day. I was dead and I was floating in an empty void. It was silent like it would be in space. But then there were voices. I looked around and there they were, all the people just like me. Shouting, screaming, asking for help, everyone of them reduced to just an echo in an empty void by life. It was those voices that woke me up. Is that where I would go when I die. I know. This may all feel silly. I don\u2019t expect you to understand. I type in google that I have depression and even before any real suggestion I see the ads for suicide helplines.

FOUR of them have newborns and another 4 are currently pregnant. These conversations are very hard. They're all so happy and have no idea why I don't talk to them as much as I used to. I ask how everything is but if the conversation is on kids too long it just hurts and I could never tell them that, I don't want them to not be happy talking about their kids. They deserve to be happy. I also just started having my wages garnished by the federal government for my student loans. Today was the second time that's happened. It was supposed to be a big paycheck because of overtime. It was not.My grandmother and a cousin died in March on the same day. Now my family is fighting over who \"has to\" take grand as 10 year old dog and I want him so so bad, but I have a dog and three cats already and my landlord doesn't know about two of those cats as it is.... The poor thing is going through just as much as we are and they're treating him like a thing. I wish I could take him.. but hearing them argue about it is sickening.My boyfriend is so very supportive but I just don't understand why. I'm such a mess and he deserves someone who has their shit together.I'm just so tired. I've never cried as much as I have so far this year and I doubt I'm done.I've had so many people tell me I need to see a doctor or a counsellor or a therapist and I agree but at the same time I feel like I should be able to handle this, I've always dealt with my problems in the past and this is just SO much. I have health insurance now and my job offers free resources for getting help, I'm just building up the courage to call. I'm supremely overwhelmed and I feel like I cry so much I'm just constantly dehydrated.....I'm so cold. So tired.

To be honest, until about 2 and a half years ago, I was a normal kid. That was the time I intercepted a letter from my dad to an unidentified person. The main message was that he announced to his wife, my mum, that he wants to separate.  I never expected this to happen, I thought we were a perfect family. Anyways, on that Friday, some ex-colleague of my dad and her kids were going to visit us. It was weird, I somehow knew that the letter was addressed to her. Details are irrelevant, so basically I told my sister first, then my dad about me having read it and then we all ended up running out of the flat crying. My dad's justification was that my mum has this genetic disease called Multiple Sclerosis and it started to drive him crazy. This disease starts to effect one's coordination physically and later mentally. So he said that he tried to separate earlier, but my mum didn't seem to care and now he is together with that lady. My mum didn't know that he was together with anyone for a long time after this.Anyways, over a few months I kind of got over the situation but I had figured that my dads girlfriend is an idiotic bipolar weird lady. When I told my dad about this, our relationship really plummeted. I struggled a lot because of this lady and our relationship wasn't too peaceful. My sister and grandparents didn't seem to be bothered by her so I talked myself into the problem being within me and my dad didn't help with that.Fast forward to February this year. I now live with my mum two and a half hours away from my dad. For a period of 2 weeks he is away and we cannot contact him easily due to internet being restricted there. His girlfriend texts me in some super provocative manner and this gets me mad too so I reply to her in an equally mad tone. She barely talks to me afterwards and when my dad shows up he blames me for the whole thing. We barely talk anymore because he seems to not be open to me on any other subject. I decide to write to him an apology letter saying that I shouldn't interfere with his relationship and we should talk it out one on one. Meanwhile I spoke to my sister and grandma and I figure they both have the same opinion on his girlfriend. I also started seeing a psychologist for this issue.Last week-end we went hiking together to talk about it. First we spoke about a bunch of different things but 2/3 the way through the hike he brings the topic of his girlfriend up. He explains what he meant before and I slowly start to give in and kind of apologize. At the end he brings up that he and his girlfriend have been trying to get a kid THREE F**KING TIMES already and failed. This was beyond my limit. I stopped talking and a bit later started crying. He asked me what was wrong. I told him I won't go have lunch at his gf's parents' place and got onto the next train towards home. I texted my girlfriend (we had been together for 5 months by then) to see if I could go to her place. She helped me talk it out and hugged me a lot. The following week due to a misunderstanding my gf and I go through hard times both at home and together. We finally talk ourselves out about our misunderstanding. I could focus on preparing for school tests again. That is when I started thinking about my dad's stuff again. I couldn't focus on my studies and had two tests the next day (today). I cried a lot in the evening but I finally managed to stop and get studying. Today the first  test went alright but I have a black-out during the second one. For the first time in ages I carefully take out my phone to look up a word I require and guess what, I got caught. I apologize to my teacher as she confiscates my phone. This is a subject in which I get 90%+ on every homework and now I fail it. I also had my interview for head student in school that day. At the same time I can't talk to anyone about it cuz I don't want people to think I just want attention.

I've been suffering from severe depression and complex post traumatic stress disorder for I don't know how long I can remember. I first was in therapy at 14. But my childhood was obviously hell from the start. This is all tragic. I think that I had potential just like anyone else  born on this earth. It was just crippled. And now I'm basically stealing oxygen from other people. I can't contribute. I can't work. I can't be a good friend. Both because I just break down and am not able to do anything time and time again. I will never be a wife. I can't have normal sexual relationships. I tried but it's just too painful for me to have sex. I guess that must be because I'm a victim of sexual assault. Though honestly some things I just don't understand about this. Maybe it is that I don't remember fully. And with not being able to have sex, I'll never be a good girlfriend, and I'll never be wife. Then I'll never be a mother. I can't offer a family because my family is so dysfunctional that you wouldn't want them around children really. I don't have many friends. Those that I do are not close because I've moved around ever since I can remember and I never had the chance to keep childhood friends. So why would anyone want me as a partner really?

I believe it doesn\u2019t go away because I view depression as something that\u2019s a reaction to life\u2019s stress and not knowing how to deal with it. In other words I believe depression is a symptom of something bigger, not a cause. Low self esteem, no confidence, Neurotic tension, need for control and obsessional thinking can all lead to depression. The process that we create our insecurities and depression in our head is a very complex one as the things I just listed are only a part of it. It happens in our environment that we interprets. With those being my beliefs I think that depression can happen all the time and at any point. It manifest in the mind. But either way each episode isn\u2019t supposed to be the same, it\u2019s not all supposed to be one huge repetitive blur which is what I feel like the state of today\u2019s therapy has turned into. We don\u2019t take the time to feel out each individual episode and help people accordingly. I feel like  all to often I hear the same things over and over again. The words I use are only to describe my psychological state and I could use the same words to describe a completely different state. I\u2019m theory a intuitive therapist would be able to feel things out and understand this. I just don\u2019t think many therapist are really living the life journey with their patients. Their emotional investment doesn\u2019t feel there. It feels like a 9-5 job for them. I know that\u2019s not all of them and I know their intent is good, however I truly do believe that holistically lots of therapist just say the same thing Over and over. Then they just give up on you. Part of this probably speaks to the fact that to become a therapist the credentials aren\u2019t really that difficult. You don\u2019t really have to know shit to be a therapist. Just get though the school and you\u2019re good to go.

I just need to rant about all of these terrible things which are piling up and up and I feel like I'm drowning under the weight of it all.\nI have an extensive background of mental illness dating back to around age 12 (I just turned 20) including major depressive disorder (treatment-resistant), PTSD, gender dysphoria, an eating disorder, and substance abuse (marijuana, LSD, alcohol and nicotine). I have attempted suicide about 4 times in my life. Last year I came out as a transgender man, and a week later my physically abusive family kicked me out of the house. I now live with my boyfriend and his massive immediate family (8 other people, one large house but we are all quite poor and use government assistance). This family has been nothing but gracious and kind to me and I don't deserve it. They would be better off (literally! Financially it would be better) if I was not here. I was unemployed for 6 months due to the depression (couldn't even get myself out of bed) and the guilt I felt at invading these kind and generous people's resources with 0 payment back to them was strong. I then got a part time job at a caf\u00e9 via recommendation from an old friend.I have trauma from multiple (like 7 or 8) involuntary admissions to psychiatric inpatient units; the care was sub par and I have been subject to chemical and physical restraint which was excessive and unnecessary. I have over $1,000 in medical bills from my most recent admission, from 11/18. That might not sound like a lot, but when your income is less than $1,000 a month... yeah. My mother had kicked me off the family health insurance out of her never-ending disdain for me which resulted in that debt. (I am now insured for free). I have had 2 instances of childhood sexual assault, an various instances of parental physical, verbal, and emotional abuse from both mother and father. I was adopted by them as a 3 year old because my biological mother was a junkie with bipolar disorder and DCYF took all her kids away from her. So even from a young age I have not been dealt a fair hand.Currently I started a medical leave from my job, and that friend who recommended me to the managers all those months ago didn't know this, thinking I just didn't show up one day. She posted a very angry status on Facebook saying \"Yeah, no one else ask me for a recommendation at my job ever again. If you can't fucking show up it makes me look unreliable and I'm over it.\" Keep in mind she was out of the loop and me and the managers had clear communication about my absence so NO it wouldn't make her look like anything, except now she looks like an ass. But many of my coworkers and mutual friends also liked and commented in agreement below that, and that leads me to believe they would all be happier without me in their life as well. I originally took leave with the intention of voluntary admission to an outpatient program, but now I've given up.I've been in therapy for 8 years. I've tried DBT, CBT,\nWellbutrin, Prozac, Abilify, Seroquel, Trazodone. Even tried microdosing LSD, and CBD products, but they didn't happen to work for me. I've been hospitalized several times, I've done instensive outpatient programs, 6 month long intensive DBT counseling, an LGBT support group, I've applied all these things to my life and thrown my whole body and soul into trying to 'get better' but nothing lifts the dull, empty feelings inside me. There are no more therapies or treatments available to me that I haven't already tried and failed. There is so much baggage clinging to me, what I've described to you above isn't even the half of it and I'm surprised I had enough energy to type this much as it is.I am also grappling with the existential despair of being a small cog in a giant corporate machine self absorbed with profit, profit, profit. All the compassion and humanity has left the world as we laugh at the misfortune of others, blame the homeless for all their problems, support a military industrial complex, and break down the pure values of society for self satisfaction. I've been in so much pain for so long and I just do not see any way out of this. I'm broke, I have no car, no savings, no house of my own. If me and my boyfriend ever broke up I'd be homeless, which forces me to acquiesce to all arguments and problems that may arise, causing an imbalance in our relationship. He also has no job and it's very frustrating coming home from work to see he's done nothing but smoke pot and invite friends over to smoke and watch TV all day.My life was destined to be shitty and it has continuously been shitty. I feel no joy from any activities I once loved. I haven't left my bed much except for the bathroom, the occasional cigarette, and for food the last 3 days. I'm on the brink of crying but no tears will come out and I sit, emotional yet numb at the same time. I don't care what happens to me.

The definition of anxiety and depression are of course negatives, and with good reasons, they suck a lot. But did you, my dear fellow Reddit reader thought about how those conditions changed you? Since I am 7 years old, I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and I've been more years of my life in medication rather than out of it. I embrace it as a part of me, and I accept that I'm not a happy person, but a person that has sometimes happy moments, and that's enough for me. In the periods of high introspection, when you feel more down, you can learn a lot about yourself, and how can you help other people about in similar situations. Anxiety always gives you the worst possible scenarios about whatever that can happen, but is that not also a benefit, in order to see what can go wrong and help people to not? Does being negative not help you to see how bad can something go and help those people around you? Think about it, embrace it, smile for once, because without sadness, there is no happiness, we need black to recognize white. Love yourself for who you are, and for how your brain is wired.I recently meet a couple of people that I know now that they will be friends for life, and they both are going through a really terrible personal bad time, and thanks to what I learned about those two terrible brain worms called depression and anxiety I helped them more than none else did, and this is not a praise for me, but a reason I want to share to you all, to see that you are not useless, you are worth, and if more people would see this, maybe society would normalize anxiety and depression, and make going to therapy a normal thing as going to the doctor when you feel fever. I know that in some years, I will be again in a phase where I don't know where am I and think that I need to learn more, I will need again therapy and some months of introspection under the blankets, but for now, the embracing of my condition and the acceptance, are the best thing I did in my more 20+ years of anxiety/depression.If you got here, thank you for reading, and specially, I really hope this words help you even if it's only a bit :)", "author": "Iromaw", "created_utc": 1554476507.0, "id": "b9s9md", "title": "Anxiety made me what I am (also AMA)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b9s9md/anxiety_made_me_what_i_am_also_ama/", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "top_comments": []}, {"body": "I started typing this out several times but the truth is it's such a stupid, complicated situation that just thinking about it is driving me insane.

During this time no one knew I had depression and even I myself was in denial about having it at the time. Back to the story, 10+ confirmed and only 3 people people ended up showing up and all 3 left early due to \u201can emergency.\u201d Ever since this happened, I have had a huge anxiety and fear over my birthday and never wanted to celebrate it with anyone other than my immediate family.Fast forward to now, I\u2019m celebrating my birthday and it took so much courage to actually plan something that included other people other than my family. Everyone who is coming knows I had depression and bipolar disorder type 2, and has been somewhat understanding of my predicament (I say somewhat because people are really starting to show their colors lately). I planned this a month in advance so everyone knows what will happen and allow people time to determine whether or not they can make it, and to accommodate everyone for traveling and boarding.

And today, as a 43 year old man, I sat on the bus, pulled my hood of my jacket over my head, put my head down, my hand over my face, and cried hard for about 15 minutes of my ride.\u200bThis is all over a woman I have been talking to who doesn't know how I feel about her. But I think I'm in love with the idea of being in her heart and her in mine more than anything. She's beautiful and I get along with her very, very well. But she's dating, and I am almost certain that any explanation of how I feel would be a disastrous thing to do. I am certain she wouldn't expect it, and obviously isn't looking for that sort of thing from me, and I know quite solidly from conversations with her I am not her type. You guessed it, I'm overweight and have a terrible diet. And I am trying yet again to do something about that but I have little faith. I could be wrong about her, but that's a gamble I cannot take, at least not now and probably not ever. I'd much rather have what I have than lose it trying to get more than that.\u200bA thought process that is, like me, a big fat trigger for depression.\u200bWhen I cried, I was dead silent. I was horrified that I was even doing it. When it subsided, I look up, and no one noticed a thing. Not. One.\u200bI feel invisible. The person I am is meaningless to most. And I have no clue how to connect with anyone. A lot of this has to do with long-term depression. I was always the kid sitting off by himself on one corner of the playground. Social avoidance almost constant. I pushed myself hard to break out of it when I was younger, and it worked for a while, but eventually my feet landed right back where I am right now, repeatedly. In complete misery. Agony, really.\u200bI have no intention of doing anything but continuing to exist, but I don't know how to do it without the suffering. I've had a battery of therapists. I've tried medication. That didn't work in any way, shape or form - and people largely blame you when it doesn't. They are so steadfast in thinking that the solution has to work, and it must be that you're too stubborn to let it.\u200bYou know what it really is? I hate myself. My self image is so far removed from my real image that I feel like garbage, like a bad part, a reject. And working on my self image has always felt futile, after all, why would I want to have a relationship or friendship with anyone that doesn't see the real me? The real me sucks, that's why. At least I suck to them, because they don't get it. They don't get what it feels like. They can't take a walk inside my head and feel the immense pain. Why would I want to be with someone who doesn't accept me for me? And me is fat. But I guess if I don't like it as much as others don't, I have to do something to change it. But I sense the judgment in people when I talk to them.\u200bOnce when I lost a lot of weight, I had friends that told me how relieved they were that I lost it. As if now I was acceptable to be in their club. I got the impression that I had risen to a level that was acceptable to them now. That was very revealing, and only confirmed that in life, people are superficial, shallow, and unrefined. And they can't be trusted when they tell you they approve of you. Because it's conditional. Unconditional love is a myth.\u200bIf I could describe my lifelong depression to someone, I would put it like this - picture someone or something you love (pet, etc.). You love them more than anything. And they die. And you're at their funeral, being hit with that reality, and feeling all that pain.\u200bNow, imagine having that pain, for either logical or illogical reasons every waking moment of every day. It's like having a second degree burn emotionally in some ways too. Every movement is pain, and you can be brave, and you can move despite the pain, but that pain is still there.\u200bIt's been almost ten years since I've had any sort of meaningful relationship with a woman. And my last relationship was so bad at the end that I can honestly say I was almost begging for death. I am scared of myself when I say that.\u200bI want help. I want to not feel like this every second of every day. I want more light than dark. I could probably manage if I could have that. Hell, I might even see beyond it and correct some of the things that bother me, and maybe things would feel more okay than they do. I want to feel like I mean something to someone. I wish I could be in love with someone like the woman I mentioned earlier, and have it reciprocated. I want the warmth of being included, needed, cared about, valued. But I don't have it, and it's caused me to turn my analytical brain on myself. And in return, my mind judges me as unfit. And condemns me.\u200bI am a broken hearted prisoner, jailed in my own mind, with a wall around my heart. Walking around amongst the masses, acting brave, charming, and happy, but I am a train-wreck inside.\u200bI don't trust therapists, I don't trust people, and I don't trust myself. I am begging God, Spaghetti Monster, Slender Man, Randy of The Redwoods, anyone for a sign. Something that will help this pain. It's simply unbearable sometimes.\u200bThank you for reading.", "author": "BurghGuy75", "created_utc": 1554475485.0, "id": "b9s27w", "title": "Sea Changes", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b9s27w/sea_changes/", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "top_comments": []}, {"body": "Your teenage years are supposed to be the best years of your life, right?

Firstly, sorry if this topic has been covered before, but every situation is different and I'm reaching out to help my mom.\u200bI feel that my mother has always been a sad soul, and after the death of my father in 2002, she's used it as an excuse not to live her life and to let the depression eat her away. Her actions has always been those of someone a little unhinged: she constantly feels her family are against her, has a shit relationship with my oldest two sisters, her younger brother (my uncle) is an alcoholic who is in and out of the house and a lot of the stress of dealing with him is put solely on her because she's the only readily available sibling to help deal with him, but the way she deals is by yelling and screaming and blaming (which makes sense, because her father committed suicide while drunk), she's made risky decisions and has let her pride carry her even further down the rabbit hole, etc... \u200bThe list goes on with my family. There is a lot of drama and psychological issues with the people here. I feel, in a way, she may even suffer from borderline personality disorder as she exhibits many of the signs and symptoms.\u200bRegardless, these last 17 years, she's wallowed the loss of my father and has refused to live her own life. I've been very afraid to leave home and live my own life because I felt I was the only thing tethering her down to earth-- out of 5 children, I'm (F26) the youngest and have the best relationship with her. But this last year, due to my new job and my boyfriend living very close to said new job, I spend most of my time at my boyfriend's place. I know that this has made her even more sad, but it can't be helped. He and I have been dating for 6 years, and it's just natural to want to move in together and build our own foundations as adults.\u200bIn the year I've been gone, her mood has drastically decreased. She doesn't want to go outside, she doesn't eat, she'll spend the whole day playing dress up and on Facebook, or talking to her best friend/aunt from her home country. However, on March 18th, that very same aunt passed away from a suicide attempt. \u200bThis lady (let's call her SM) was my mom's rock. However, SM had the same relationship with her daughter that my mom has with me-- SM's mentality was a bit warped and she began hallucinating, causing her to rely on her 33 year old daughter heavily for her happiness, which was causing her daughter's marriage and her friendships to deteriorate. However, SM's daughter spent 24/7 with her mom, with an exception of 2 days a week here and there. On March 17th, in an attempt to gain pity from her daughter after a fight about wanting her to leave her husband and move back home, SM drank a small portion of weed killer. SM was 66 and already really weak, and given that she lives in a very poor South American country with not the best resources, she passed away two days later. SM passed away leaving her daughter to carry the burden and the false guild that SM's death was on her hands, and not SM's selfishness.\u200bMy mother's reaction to this is, \"I'm so sad she's gone. I had no idea what she was dealing with, but... I think about it all the time. And I don't think I can go on much longer without SM.\"\u200bI was broken up about SM's death, and still am. But a piece of the reason I'm not dealing so well with SM's death very well is because of how much of my mom and I that I see in this situation. I want to help my mom with her depression or whatever is wrong with her because for years, she has always alluded to wanting to commit suicide, and I know an attempt was made when she was very young, and I just can't lose her to this. My mom seems so in love with being miserable. I've tried talking her into going to therapy. I've suggested going to the gym. I've offered to take her outside. But she's constantly refusing. \u200bI need her to change. And I need her to see that she's tearing up the people around her. And I need her to see that she has a life she can value and add meaningfulness to. \u200bSorry for the long letter and if it doesn't make sense. I'm a little lost right now about all this.

Warning: references to self-harm.I (17 M) recently moved overseas with my grandparents in Germany from America.  My parents and sisters are still over there and should be moving over within the next year or two. The last few months of my life haven't been very good, to say the least. Or else I wouldn't be posting here. Back in America,  I was an A/B student. I was in the cross country + track and the swimming teams, and I had a good number or friends,  especially for someone more reserved. and introverted like I tend to beBut now I'm consistantly overcome by this will to hide and do nothing.\nI want to be productive. I want to be studying and mastering my German. \nI want to be enjoying my hobbies and improving my skills. I want to be making new friends and bettering myself as a person.But I can't. As much as I want to I cant. I've tried talking to my parents and grandparents.  They show concern, but assume the sad thoughts is me missing my family and the lack of productivity is me being lazy. In fact, they took me to a doctor. They did little to nothing: took a physical examination, checked my balance and locomotion, then they asked a few questions that I couldn't answer honestly because my grandma was right there and I didn't feel comfortable. So of course they said I was just having a hard time being away from my family. But what if they're right? It's what I want to believe,  and it's what I have belived in for the most part. \nI just dont know this anymore. Now,  I'll continue with why I think it may be more. I do have very negative thoughts.  Incredibly negative.  Whenever I get a bad grade I call myself stupid. My thoughts tell me I'm a disappointment to myself and my family. \nWhenever I see a German text to read I give up instead of trying, like I should be.\nWhenever I look into the mirror, I see every damn little flaw and get repulsed.\nI look at my comics and I see every little line and tell myself they'll get nowhere if they're that messy.\nI've always been insecure.  Thats normal, especially for someone my age.  But this? I just don't know.Now the icing on the cake is an issue that I dont like talking to anyone about,  especially my parents and grandparents.  Back when I lived in America,  I had a long-distance boyfriend(18 M, now ex). (For clarity, I am gay. My family knows and embraces it.) Normally it's nothing, especially when you're in high school. Frankly he should have been irrelevant and the \"relationship\" should have died off like most teenage long distance relationships do. \nBut it didn't.\nWe grew very, very close. He quickly became my best friend as I learned how similar we were, and eventually, a deep sexual interest did form.I will be referring to my ex-boyfriend as he for the rest of this. He's the only other person I'll be referring to as that on the story, so it shouldn't be too confusing, hopefully. Where it goes wrong is the fact that he has clinical depression.  I made it better for him, and he was the one person who I could trust, the main person in which I could \"be myself\" around. He grew up in a horrible environment (unstable lower-class family, high drug usage, very \"conservative\" surroundings aka the American bible belt). Very bad,  especially for someone of his sexual orientation. Meanwhile I grew up very protected in a stable middle class family.Then came the choice. I stay in America, in a state that I hated on all levels (Florida) but I get to have a future with this amazing guy whom I never met, or I go to Germany, the country where I was born and I had many fond memories of, where the other half of my family is, and where I could get a cheaper college education. Like most people would have done, I chose Germany. Later I regreted that choice. We broke up. He felt betrayed by one of the only people who he could trust. I lost my best friend. We still talk now, he's forgiven me, but he has a lot personal issues and im thinking the loneliness and loss in faith for humanity is really pushing him to suicide. That and his very obvious statements of wishing he could escape have been convincing me. \nWhere that whole situation is going is a whole other story, and frankly,  I'm scared. (For context, of those skeptical of this relationship being emotionally abusive,  it wasn't.  He didnt guilt trip me or make me feel like that bad guy. He didn't use suicide as a threat. He truly is out of options.) How this affected me is honestly quite easy to imagine. After we started talking again, I began to realize what I made him go through and I was overcome by guilt.  So much. It still lingers today. I still feel like the bad guy. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself,  especially if he ends up killing himself.  He tells me it's not my fault anymore.  That someone else wronged him.  He's right but he wouldn't have meet this person if I had stayed. This, mixed with all the insecurity,  isolation, and self-loathing, eventually lead to me self harming.  It happened once and only my ex knows. \nI did at one point have scary suicidal thoughts. I thought of how reliving it would be to be free of everything. How nice it would be to just not be. That's where my fear of this being depression is comming from. I'm afraid to say I'm depressed to my parents because what if it's a phase? All the hormones? I don't want to be one of those idiots who say they're depressed because the world sucks and because it's a trend. Frankly I'm hoping this will pass. I don't want this to become a huge issue. I don't want this to draw attention.  But I'm so afraid. Thus why I came to reddit for this. I just dont know. I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to scare away the new friends I made and bring them down. I need a fresh opinion.  A critical one.Lay it on me, reddit. Am I a lazy, edgy teenager?  Or should I really seek help? \nFeel free to ask follow ups.  There is a lot I left out.  Thank you so much to anyone who read through this. It means the world.

My poor, tired heart was bursting with relief and it felt like the sun was rising for the first time in my life.My wife congratulated me and said she was preparing a celebratory sexy time for when I got home. I was excited! I haven't had a proper loving since forever, thanks to this project!5:00 finally came. But as bad luck would have it, a client made an emergency appointment, just as I was getting out the door. I had to extend for ten minutes or so.When I texted my wife I'd be a bit late; she was understandably disappointed.And that's where the shit hit the fan.\"You killed my mood\" she texted me.Just a very innocent, simple text that probably didn't mean anything at all. But, as I was holding in all the accumulated stress, that text just killed my mood, as well. Not just my mood, but my entire confidence. I let her down. She prepared something for me, and yet I couldn't make it home in time. I was the worst husband in the world.Now, this kind of demeanor is what my demons live for, and by God, did they pounce at my vulnerable mind like a pack of hungry, rabid wolves. It was a diabolical cacophony inside my skull.Needless to say, I came home with my head in a dark place. A very dark place. My wife was giving me the silent treatment and I was paralyzed, stuck inside my own head. Seeing me in that state made her even madder. God, I wanted to hug her, tell her I was sorry, that it was just a minor setback.The problem is, once I get stuck inside my own head, there's just no getting out. I'd just wait it out until the episode passes.So I was stuck there,my body won't move. I was paralyzed, almost catatonic, helpless, unable to soothe and calm my wife. And that helpless state it deepened my depressed state.She started saying very nasty things at me, which I'm sure she didn't mean. Still, I was paralyzed, catatonic; and with every word she said, I was sinking deeper into the bottomless ocean under the black storm inside my head. I just wished she'd stop saying those things, but she needed to let it out. I couldn't let her bottle it all up inside her.I sank deeper and deeper. Deeper than I have ever been before. It was pitch black, I was finally at the very bottom of my depression. It was a VERY dark place. And in that place, I had no wife, no beutiful daughter, no parents, no loving family, no ambitions. The world vanished. The whole universe didn't exist.It was just me, in the very bottom of the middle of the ocean under a black storm, with my demons swirling around me like a school of sharks, if shark even swam in schools at all. It was suffocating. I just couldn't bear the weight of it all. I had to get out. I needed to get out. My mind was choking me, and I had to make it stop.It was time. Time finally fight and defeat my mind. I had the upper hand; I've always had the upper hand all along. How could I not have thought of it?

So, I tried again. It was my very first time, so I'm not sure I knew what I was doing. I was like, \"damn this glass is dull AF\". So, I kept cutting so it could go deeper. My wife who had just left the room, probably heard the breaking of the glass. She came in, probably shocked, jumped and tackled me.

I need your help!\u200bLet me give you my story:I am a 19 years old male and I am in my first year of college. My youth wasn't super bad, but it wasn't good either.\u200bIn primary school, I was bullied a lot. I never understood why they bullied me, they just did. There were quite moments when everything was fine but on other moments I got beat up almost every day. My reactions were also making things worse as I reacted aggressively. Because the bullies were outnumbering me I got punished for my aggressive reactions and they didn't. School was hell for me. My grades were good but my confidence level was below 0.\u200bIn middle school, I wasn't bullied anymore. I had a lot of friends, across multiple courses. However I never felt that the friends, in my course, accepted me in the group. I felt left out. They made group chats without me and would go out without asking me to go with them.  I would hang out with them most of my time at school as we were following the same course and had breaks at the same time. However I would go to my other friends when that was possible.The most painful moment was when one of my so called friends of my course organized a \"Sweet 16\" and invited everyone except me. The hard part was that he told it right into my face. He asked if anyone had something he needed for the party, I don't remember what is was but I had it laying around so I told him: \"I have what you need, you can borrow it if you want.\" He answered with a smile on his face: \"Nice, but you aren't invited\". That felt like a knife right into my heart. My confidence level dropped even more.\u200bThe reason I was left out might be because I had an unusual hobby. I love to work with technology and develop my own. I am currently studying something along those lines and I really liked it. I tried not to talk about it when with my friends but I sometimes did and that could be the reason I was being left out.\u200bMy first semester of college was like heaven. I met friends that had the same interests as me. I felt accepted in the group and I wasn't being left out. As I had a lot of experience with the topics we had before I went to college, my grades were good and I passed all my exams. My confidence level was, for the first time in my life, growing again. I felt great!\u200bIn the week after the exams, when we didn't have to go to school, there was this big festival in my neighborhood. I go every year with some friends that I know from one of my hobbies and it is always amazing and fun. This year something special happened. I fell in love with a girl that I recently met. We went out together and I really felt connected with her. It felt like she liked me as well. I have never had a relationship before and I actually never felt love like I feel for her. After the festival was over I started chatting with her hoping to eventually start a relationship. However it wasn't really going well. One of her friends, which is a friend of mine as well, told me that she has no feelings for me and that she doesn't really want a relationship. That really hurt me. It was again, like a knife right into my heart. But I accepted it, and I thought that the pain would go away. But it hasn't gone away. For the past month I have been feeling permanent pain. I can no longer sleep properly, I am tired every day and my apatite is gone completely. What happened somehow triggered something in me that completely changed who I am. I no longer like the hobbies I liked to do and my grades and motivation at school are as low as they have ever been. When someone would ask me what I am studying I would be ashamed to tell them. I am no longer proud of what I am doing. My confidence is as low as it has ever been and I am losing more and more reasons to live every day.There have been days that I was waiting on the train to go to school and that I felt a super strong urge to jump in front of it. It felt like someone was shouting at me to do it. I know suicide is not a solution but living like this isn't worth living for.\u200bWhat do I do now Reddit?

Just being myself  gets the job done, and I don't even bear hatred to these people. I simply understand that I am incompatible. I finished a major that I lost all interest in. I can't start something new because I lose motivation eventually. I am feeling my cognitive abilities degenerate. Wellbutrin doesn't do shit. Concerta doesn't do shit. Being alone is great, but I don't have the self discipline or motivation to make use of time.

I wasn't a innately social creature in the first place. These characteristics have been weeded out by design, by evolution,  like darwinism, and I saw it happen, going from bad to non existent. Honestly I know it's better for me that way. I always was the outside who never fit in. Before, it has lead to endless frustration, while seeing no improvements despite my efforts. It feels somewhat better to feel less frustration, but now I sense another change happening and that's the decline of my cognitive abilities, the worsening symptoms of adhd and major depression. I don't want this to happen and I have been actively engaged in therapy (talk therapy won't work on me). I just desperately hope that I run into the right medicine.

Over half my life. I've tried every damn thing I can think of. Therapy. Too many meds to count. Bad coping mechanisms. Alcohol. Drugs. Self harm. Good coping mechanisms. Exercise. Yoga. Meditation.And no matter what I try, do you know what it does for me? Nothing. I try so fucking hard, and for the longest time, it got worse every year. Then every month. Now every day. I used to be so hopeful. So optimistic. I felt like I could someday get over whatever the hell is wrong with me, but those days are long since past. I don't remember the last time I felt happy. I enjoy things I suppose, but they don't fill me with joy and excitement like they should. They just sort of make me feel content. Something other than misery is always welcome, but what's the point of living if you're content at absolute best. Some days, nothing even makes me feel that good. Anhedonia has been a regular visitor to my life since I was, oh I don't know, 9?I don't like myself, but I don't feel I deserve to die due to my own self hatred. I don't think I deserve to die at all. But living just feels like my own personal hell. I can't really say any part of me wants to live, or that any part of me is afraid of dying, but what I am afraid of is another failed attempt. That's all that really holds me back.I used to deal with things so well. I have an obvious deformity, I've dealt with lifelong poverty among other things, and I can't afford necessary medical treatment for genuine health issues, but somehow I always kept going. The cards were always stacked against me but I kept trying. One thing would go wrong after the next but it couldn't deter me. Eventually though, something in me just. Broke. I'm not that person anymore. That person's been dead and gone for years. Even if I had nothing wrong with me at all, and I had a good life, I'm fairly certain I'd still feel the way I do. Maybe I'd be healthier or easier on the eyes or more financially stable, but I can't help but feel at this point that my problems go deeper than life obstacles, and that something's deeply wrong with my mind.I talked to my best friend today.\nHe's a good kid. Big dreams. He just got accepted into college. Wants to be a comedian and a writer. He asked me if I had the choice between being happy sometime in the future, or never being happy, but being able to effortlessly end my life right now, which would I choose? The question didn't bother me, we're very open with each other, but what bothered me was how quickly decided I'd give up on guaranteed future happiness for an immediate end to my pain. And the hurt and disappointment I felt from him when I answered? Well, it still stings too, I'll be honest.I tried my best, and it never got better. Even when everything goes right, it gets worse. I never wanted to be like this. I never wanted to live like this. I had dreams and aspirations at one point, but they finally faded away like everything else.

I can't remember how much I cried as a kid because my friends always left me out, and I ended up crying in the corner of an isolated room, just wishing they cared about me too. They loved playing and talking with my sister, but I was ignored. Even my best friend felt distant from me. My dad was an alcoholic, and I always wondered why he smelled so gross. I went to his \"office\" a lot as a kid, since I've always loved video games and he had given me a desktop there to play on. His friend wanted to do a song or whatever, so my dad invited this woman- she was beautiful, maybe french? She had long orangeish red hair, and a beautiful face. She sung like an angel too. I didn't think anything of it, because I figured my dad was just her friend. When I told my mom, she seemed suprised and maybe a little sad. First major panic attack of my life. I got scared, and after I told her if I remember correctly- I went up to my room and stared out the window, wondering how my family would react if I simply jumped out. I never could do it. Maybe someday. My dad started going to this band practice, he played trombone and wanted to fuck around and practice with some guys. I went with him a lot, and my cousin came too sometimes since her dad was there too. We played monopoly on my iPad (first gen, still have it. still works too) and we had a lot of fun. But then he started telling me I couldn't come with him, and he was starting to dress a little too fancily for band practice. I didn't really think anything of it. Around this time, my grandmother (from my dad's side) was struggling terribly with alzheimers. Maybe other health issues too. I- I actually witnessed her last breath. I heard the machine's beeps slow down, and then it started to sound strange. I asked what was wrong to my dad and uncle, and they just took me out of the room. In the car, my dad told me she'd died. No sugar coating. I felt so sad, like it was my fault. Maybe it was. I don't know. When I got home, I saw my mom crying in her room. She was looking at her phone, at emails I believe. I asked her what was wrong, and I gave her a big hug. She said she was sad about grandmommy, (that's what we called her) and I said I was too. I went to my room, and I don't remember what happened afterwards. They seemed a lot more distant, but they didn't split up. Might I tell you, my dad sexually harassed me a lot. Some of it was innocent, like hugs and stuff. Other times, he'd put his mouth over my nose and blow into my nose. It hurt a lot, and I hated when he did it. I don't know why he did it. I barely remember this- but I was with my grandma, (my mom's) and she was watching me and my sister in the house. That was the day my mom had a miscarriage of little Elizabeth. I cry a lot, wishing she had a chance at living. I'd of given up my life for her to have a chance. My mom was so desperate for a new, better child she adopted. That changed me. I knew she just wanted something new. I cried so much, feeling like I was replaced. Now, I'm 16 and I don't give a single FUCK about their love anymore. Back on the earlier parts. Some years ago, maybe 2015? Me, my mom, and my sister went to a rehab to see if they could get information and see if my dad would maybe accept. Of course he didn't accept the fucking help. Later, the thanksgiving of 2016. My little brother, the adopted child, is very energetic and gets bored very easily, likes to mess with people. He was 7 at the time. He slid an icecube down the back of my dad's shirt- (he was obviously either on a hangover or drunk) my dad smacked him, and my brother hit the ground. My mom and sister started yelling at him, and my mom kicked him out of the house. Me? I sat there quietly for a second, before getting up and going to my room as calmly as I could. Once I was in there, I remember hiding in my closet, under a spare blanket I kept in there. I was as quiet as an alley cat, listening for any sounds outside that could be my dad, coming after me. I was scared. I think he went to some rehab after that, didn't really do much. I don't really remember though- my memory isn't the best. He's sober now, goes to AA. He lives in a trailer though, rarely visits. Only to bring my brother for a night or so to get him out of my mom's hair. My brother only goes there because he can play as much games as he wants, my dad doesn't care at all. He could be watching illegal stuff, and my dad wouldn't care. He'd just tell him to turn the volume down probably. I was the same way. I'd go with him because he always would get me lunch, and let me play games on his phone. And he'd play music that I liked. He played a lot of stuff like Squeeze, Talking Heads sometimes, a few other that I don't remember. Mostly Squeeze. Their songs are imprinted into my mind, filling my mind with both nice, and horrible memories. A bit more recently, he was tickling me on the floor in my sister's room. I was trying to tell him to stop, and I really didn't like it. He was like, laying on me tickling me. I eventually got my way out, and gave him a \"what the fuck?\" kind of look.

All I felt was a kiss on the side of my neck, I practically leapt out of my bed, and glared at my dad.

I feel like he might of... Done some other, more awful things to me when I was too young to remember. I have all the side effects of CSA, and he has quite a lot of characteristics of a- well, you know. DFCS has been notified, since I cut the fuck out of my leg because I felt so disgusting and weak that I couldn't make him stop. I told my therapist, and showed her a picture of my wounds. She told me I needed to go to the hospital right away, and she got DFCS notified. They haven't interviewed him, or us. But they know, and if he does anything, they can really take action. I didn't get institutionalized, (even though I have been, twice) they just cleaned up the wounds and let me off the hook since I said I did it because of my dad. Not entirely true, but it got me off the hook. Might make another long rant about my body dysmorphia, stay tuned if you want to see more depressing shit. Please help me.

The thing is i could not have a relationship with my daughter and that was killing me and i knew that my Ex would make it impossible for me at that Time.At that Time I had 2 wonderful \"Girlfriends\" and i would have been so happy to be with both of them, i think to this day that i genuinely loved them both.I began smoking weed before going to work, i started getting lazy, overeating, i stopped going to the Gym. \nSomething was bothering me , I had to tell them the Truth so i did. \nThey forgave me.I am still in a relationship with one of them we live together and i can't imagine my Life without her.   A few months later after cutting on the weed, i began having massive headaches, i was feeling weak to the point that i stayed on off days on my couch.\nThe headaches made it impossible to have an argument without feeling like getting stabbed in the brain.\nI went to a doctor and made a bunch of tests.\nNothing was off with my Body he suggested that i may have a depression and prescribed me something for the headaches.\nHe warned me that the Pill acts as an anti depressant if i take the full dosage.\nHalf a pill every night before sleeping and the pain went away.\nI stopped taking it after 2 weeks and went again to the weed. Fast Forward to the last 6 Months: \nThe Good:\ni have my daughter regularly at home now and i'm finally Divorced, I feel loved by the people surrounding me.The Bad:\nI'm getting more lazier every day, i gained 45 pounds, i have no sexdrive at the moment, i cry a lot. I'm not self-medicating since 2 days and i'm having terrible headaches. \nI don't do ANYTHING i should except work and it's possible that i won't do it for long.Dieting is getting harder, the Gym seems to be so far now, Some people are being judgmental about my weight gain.I finally accepted the fact that i am depressed\ni want to be as good as possible for the people around me but i don't know what to do.Thank you for reading ", "author": "Molocko", "created_utc": 1554456251.0, "id": "b9oz4o", "title": "i'm finally accepting it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b9oz4o/im_finally_accepting_it/", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "top_comments": []}, {"body": "I [M30] am still deeply in love with my best friend / ex roommate [F38] who can\u2019t return the feelings.

You've been standing alone in this shadow of guilt, feeling afraid, betrayed, and run down by hate. Just remember where you came from and all that you've been, so that when your time comes, your sons will still win.

In high school it go worse. Everyone was so judgemental. I was never really social until high school though. I found my crew of people I vibed with and it was nice. But even after breaking out of my anti social shell. I still felt like a failure. Got bad grades. Didnt really try. Mom was always stressed out about something. Over all I never truly felt happy. In recent years I've felt a little more at peace with myself and happier with myself. But ever since I actually began working. I've felt like complete and utter shit. I'm currently working at a Walmart and it is both the worst and the best job I've ever had. And I've had bad jobs. Today was another breaking point where the bosses make you feel like shit. You could be going at it 100%! And they still say it's not good enough! You're doing good but need to get better. And it just breaks me! Because no matter how hard I try or how high I climb this mountain called life. No matter many counter punches I through, i still get knocked down. And lately it just feels so much better to stay down. Getting back up is such a chore. Finding the will or the strength is a struggle. I try to turn to religion and pray and find my peace that way. I try to have that no mercy attitude to get me through the day. But all it takes to break me is hearing that I'm not good enough. I could be moving mountains and creating miracles and it's still not enough. I'm still stuck at home with my mom. I love her but I'd like to fly away soon. Yet pay check to pay check is my life. I try not spending on many things or eating out. I save but one thing after another keeps happening or the Bill's came out higher this month! And it's just so exhausting. Its like I'm living just to die and it hurts because I see so many people do what I would want to do. And it makes me so jealous! It makes me say, I wish I had that life! I wish I had your life because it seems way simpler than mine! There are days where I ask God. Just take me, please! I dont wanna live like this anymore. But he doesnt. They say it's because he has a greater calling for me. But what is it? When will it show itself? When will I begin to live?! I just want to feel some sort of happiness. I dont wanna cry anymore. I dont wanna feel so much anger anymore. So much hate. And I dont know what to do! What the hell do I do?! \nI'm just so frustrated.

Last couple days I\u2019ve been listening to meditations on YouTube so I don\u2019t understand why I got so upset today.I had bouts of crying, stopping and then crying again. I went to a commercial acting workshop  and it was hard, a bit jarring. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so hard; I was so in my head and my teacher told me I should\u2019ve had my lines prepared and in a real situation I would be wasting directors times on a $1000 shoot.  I don\u2019t think she meant to make me feel pressured but I did...I had taken a month off previously because I was moving and going through some stuff. I was so out of my comfort zone and it felt like so much to do to be \u201cHappy and like able, so that you\u2019ll get hired!\u201d I was also upset because it seemed she was giving the other students the answers they needed, but when I got the chance to ask a question, it was a short or one word answer... I drove home crying and then before I turned onto the highway, there was a pedestrian crossing so I didn\u2019t turn right away. I heard a honk and I still don\u2019t move. The car pulls up beside me and this guy asks me why wasn\u2019t I moving? And I blew it and cussed him out saying that there was a fucking man walking and how dare you fucking honk at me and fuck you!!! He told me to calm down but I did not... I hardly ever get so angry that roll down my window to yell at another driver... I continued crying on and off until midnight.I\u2019m contemplating antidepressants, but I haven\u2019t done all the other things to the best of my ability yet and I\u2019m taking Accutane. I recently got a biopsy so I haven\u2019t been able to exercise regularly so I think that might be contributing to my bad mood but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to feel this bad.
