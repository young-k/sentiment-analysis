It wasn't until my younger brother had a breakdown and got diagnosed with depression/anxiety did I take a look at myself and go see a doctor. Luckily my wife was there to point out all of this and encourage me to seek medical help. We're currently living out of the US and I don't have a job. I've always been a high achiever and busy in a lot of stuff since high school and had a job straight out of college. Being at home made me feel worthless and I started losing interest in all my hobbies. I escaped through playing games for long hours. Luckily I have a strong support system between my family and friends, but that only makes me feel worse because I shouldn't have a reason to be depressed and other people have worse things going on in their lives. So my doctor helped me work through these issues and prescribed me some antidepressants (effexor). I started putting my best foot forward to love myself some more. I meditated (something I have kept doing and look forward to every day), I found joy in weightlifting again, I began writing and reading, and I cut back the video game time even if that means I'm just with my thoughts. I didn't feel anything from the effexor, but the doc just had me on a low dosage. When he bumped it up I noticed a big difference the next week and I started to feel like myself again. Until yesterday. Yesterday felt like my first bad day in about a month and today just feels worse. I feel irritated with everything again and overwhelmed. I'm just going to take a nap because I don't want to be awake right now. I've never self harmed or thought about it so no need to worry on that front. It's just that I feel like I'm so tired from something and if I sleep I can deal with it.

We also offer counsiling services to students -- you get 10 sessions free. Seems like a good deal on the surface.I feel like a probably have had depression and anxiety most of my life, but I started wondering if I was depressed fall of my sophomore year. I had done exceptionally well my first few semesters and only got my first B that semester. Unrelated to the B, I called the offered counsiling service I mentioned earlier. It was October. Then woman said she could put me on a waiting list, but the first available appointment was January. So I didn't bother to go.I really struggled spring of my sophomore year. I called January and got an appointment in March, AFTER I told receptionist that I thought it was an 'emergency', as I was suicidal. I thought that was quite ridiculous, so I ended up being referred to a low income clinic where they could see me in two weeks. Now they don't have a psychiastrist there, but they did have a student getting her masters in psychology that became my counsiler. And a nurse I had to make serparate appointments to see that put me on 4 or 5 different medications, one of which turns out it could interact with a medicine I was taking at that time.This whole time as well, I'm emailing my professors. I wonder if I'm asking for too much. The professors refered me to our accomodations office and the accomodations office told me it all came down to my professors. My professors then would say they can't do anything without documentation and the psychologist refuses to provide documentation because of Hipaa. So, the professors then say to go talk to accomodations about it...and it went on and on for literally months, nearly a year, before I got temperary accomodations.I continued to struggle and the modest accomodations I had were running out. Eventually, I stopped going to the psychologist and went to my appointment at the school's service. First, they evaluate you. Then you have to wait two weeks for another appointment. Third, you have an introductory meeting with your counselor that they have paired you with. This lady was nice, but I soon discovered the it was 'against policy' for them to provide excuses. And it would 'take time' for them to fill out the paperwork to get me accomodations. They apparently had to 'get to know me'. Meanwhile, I'm failing classes. And at this point, I'm livid. Every time a checked on my paperwork, I got told to come back in two weeks for an update. The paperwork was literally one page long. I eventually had a fall out with that psychologist and her response was just to get me the paperwork. I then stopped going to her.So then I eventually got permanent accomodations. Except now, I am currently trying to complete coursework from multiple semesters and trying to graduate. My advisor told me that I just started doing badly when the classes got hard, so she is no help. There's barely any class availabilty and things are conflicting my schedule and really I'm just trying to graduate. I am seeing an actual psychiastrist that gave me the right medication, officially diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and a couple phobias, and so now I'm doing a lot better emotionally. BUT I am in this giant hole I dug myself where I told my parents I'm graduate a particular semester, but it's seeming less and less likely that I can because of the inflexibility of advisors and professors.I just sent my adviser an email, after dealing with more schedule conflicts. She had told me that we were basically out of options, so I thanked her for her time and told her that I was taking this higher up.Beleive or not, this is the short version. I never get responses in r/depression or r/anxiety or r/ocd, so I put in this effort hoping people would actually respond. So any help is appreciated!Do you think I am wrong for this?

I am 17 (5 months to 18) years old boy. Basically I spent most of my time playing video games and watching videos. From time-to-time I go out to run or to just thing how worthless I am and how I am doing nothing to get better. I was not sure if I was depressed or not because I was not always feeling down but after I read some of the post in this subreddit I found I may be depressed.So let's go in the main part! I am not sure if I was feeling sad, frustrated,  lacking in confidence  and so on before I spoke to the girl I like and found that she don't have same feeling to me!! After this point I  began feeling sad, unhappy and so on. I ask her why she won't date me and she said that the problem is not in me and in general she won't date guys at her age. I forgot to mention that happened 2 months ago. I have close friend who is about 29 years old and he thought me how to approach to her and what to do, basically he is teaching me more than my father and I never thought I feel him that close to me before writing this down. He is one of my few friends to which I talk openly. I feel more open to my friends than my family. I don't look at my parents as such a big support. More of the time they are at work. Working hard so we can grow  well with my sister (she is 25 years). She was studying in UK  and we are from Bulgaria. We are not really \"rich\" but I have never missed something. I always  had food, clothes, boots,  roof above my head and big porting of useless expensive things. Probably most of you know that studying in UK in not really cheap. So I never saw my parents first people to which I should talk especially my father. He normally come back home late after I went to bed and most of the time he is drinking and getting hard to talk with(He never beat me nor he had slapped me and things like this ) he is good person in general but I hardly see him. Usually when I see him I just want things which I clearly don't need and we start yelling at each other and I go to my room after 5 to 10 minutes. But from time to time we all talk (me, mom and dad since my sister is living in UK) and we have GREAT time laughing and telling jokes.Sorry for this long distraction but I got really emotional. So basically after I spoke to this girl and after she politely rejected me I felt sad and not worth living. I have suicidal thought every one of two days but they are short lived because I am not that \"strong\" to even try.  I am felling worthless and that my life will end after I turn 18 (in 5 months) in general after I stop having contact with the girl. We are in the same class and probably this is big factor. I had goals involving in making money so I am so kind of \" independent  and mature\" because she is working and she is probably more mature than me. Most of the time I am really childish. Doing child like things saying stupid things just to make people laugh and pay more attention to me. I have tried not doing it and acting more mature but I couldn't stop myself to act like child. My goals are something like to become \" a  millionaire  at 18 \" so  I can win her but I am not doing anything. I started training which I wanted to do for a long time but never trained for more than a week. So again I can look more mature.  But yesterday we had a party with my class and she was talking with one boy(from my class) for another boy(guess he is older than us) which she liked and the whole time she showed 0 interest in me and stayed with the boy from my class. That is the moment when I found she won't be with me for the near 1 or more. I still hope I can at least go to the prom with her or to have some more close contact with her. The prom in my country if when we graduate at 12th class and now I am 11th so I have about and year. My friend(the 29 year-old one ) told me that I will stop thinking about her after 1-2 moths but seeing her everyday doesn't help. Also  every time I check Instagram or some social media I look for her new posts. And I don't want to say this to her(I never told her that \"I love her\" I just asked her if she has interest in me ) so she doesn't feel guilty and also it will get a lot more awkward.Other thing is that I am really lazy or just scared to get out of my comfort zone. Basically I am really hyped to do something for no more than a week. Had a lot of goals which I just scrapped because of laziness. I had talked with some friends and people about this, had looked for info in the internet but nothing helped( this feels like another try :D ). I still spent big portion of my time in front of the computer. Also I am not that of a social person.  I prefer having few friends. In general I have 2 friends which I can ask for everything and they will help how they can, one of them is the 29 year old and my best friend  is at my age. Also my best friend found(not sure if \"found\" is correct word) and even lost his virginity. I am not  jealous  of him or anything I just always thought I will find a girlfriend first I am actually happy for him. Other of mine problems is that I just wait everything to come itself to me(which is impossible) and I don't make anything to get what I want.Also I am really aggressive to some people in school(because this is the main place where I meet with people) and also really energetic there doing some stupid things which disturb most of the people. Probably I do this so people like me and pay more attention to me but in a recent time they started calling me \"toxic\" basically really aggressive and making fun of people. I thought that I should lose some energy so I don't act stupid in school and I started running but haven't go jogging for about a month. At least I think this is one good decision to start jogging so I can spend some energy and I can think about things and how am not doing anything!So I hope someone read this. If there are even two people which read it I will be really happy :) . In the process of writing it I started crying which is not that normal for me but last few days I was felling like doing it and I am happy I cried even for a bit. The most stupid thing is that I know where my mistakes are and how to correct them but I am not doing it!!!! So if you have any  advice I will appreciate them.PS.

People with mental illness dont recognise that things arent right.'Oh wow ok. This was one of the reasons i didnt go to the doctor when i first showed signs of depression. I thought it must be attention seeking because all id heard was people with real depression are quiet and keep it to themselves. So thats what i proceeded to do because hey im not depressed if i think i might be depressed.And then they started telling me stuff about my situation (how my mam was clear of cancer now) that might have made things better. Funnily enough my mam has never had cancer and therefore hasnt been cleared of it. My notes were right in front of her and she still got it all wrong. Im starting therapy (CBT) in the next couple of weeks. The only reason its finally getting done is because of how close i was to killing myself last week.
