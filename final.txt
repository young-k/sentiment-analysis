I feel like shit most days and not sure how to control it sometimes i cannot speak to anyone and barely can hold conversations with people because i either in my mind the whole conversation or i  think ive said something wrong to offend them and then i start nitpicking what they said to understand it and then just go into detail about the topic and once thats finished we end up sitting there in thought blanky looking around the room its so pathetic . Life is really tough and i just recently left my old job and started a new one which i was looking forward to doing and on my first day i met 2  girls ( ones about 35) other is around (20 ) i also to forgot to mention im 18M. but throughout my first day it was hard to even speak to them without thinking twice  i felt like access weight and sat there and listened to them speak. i want to be able to have fluent conversation like how i once did but now i can barely even look people into the eyes, im going down hill and often sometimes think about ending my life . it can get tough and im barely getting ahold of my life . i feel worthless , awkward, stupid , and pretty much everything in the book atm. ive been to the doctors twice to discuss mental health but both times ( walk in clinic ) she hasn't really helped with much ive had blood tests and a heart test to check if i was deficient in anything and we never heard a call back. my parents arent the most supportive either and when i bring up my mental health they roll their eyes back and complain about something more relevant. i was once a social person but still a little socially awkward and about 3 weeks ago stopped talking to my friends for week to get control of my mental health and i still feel life isnt worth it. i want to successful one day but thinking about it even gets me anxious. not really sure what to do ive checked out no fap and been doing that for almost a month now with no effects still feeling the same. Ive talked to my friends about this many times , brought it up with my parents and they pushed it to the side and now here i am typing on this subreddit. so sum it up im pretty much socially awkward with a past of being social and now feel as if my thoughts are out to get me ive tried everything to mediation to getting my blood taken and still need help if any of you guys can relate to this please let me know what i can do to help. i desperately need it. also there isnt any mental health problems in my family but alzheimer and dementia.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554785272.0, "author": "youngpizzalord", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bb3sbn/am_i_alone_in_feeling_like_the_universe_keeps_me/", "title": "Am I alone in feeling like the universe keeps me lonely?", "id": "bb3sbn", "body": "We all have the same 24 hours in a day or so the saying goes, so why does it feel like I spent most of it alone, even if I'm around people?

Now hes going without me because would rather die there than continue here. And if he stays, he says he'll make sure he diesHello everyone!I've posted here before to talk about my fiance, and I will be honest, not much has changed in his behavior. He has successfully alienated most if not all of his friends, some of his family, basically leaving me to be his only support system. But that's not why I'm here.In January, the military moved my eldest sister (ES) to a very cool country that is very far away (think across the globe). After she settled in, she told me that if I ever got sick of my job and living in my country, my fiance and I could go live with her rent free for as long as she is stationed there. While this is a super generous offer and if I was in the same place I was three years ago, I would have taken her up on that offer. But I currently love my job (even though it only pays $15/hr) and I have a great group of friends and I'm closer to my middle sister (MS), who is my best friend.My fiance, on the other hand, was ecstatic to here that we have this opportunity to go and live in what is essentially his favorite country rent free until we found our own way. He's been going on multiple tangents a day on how our political and economic climate sucks in our country and we shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. He currently watches dogs at our apartment, so he spends his days drinking gin, playing video games, or sleeping, so his attachment to this country is absolutely non existant. These are his reasons on going:the pay is betterthe political climate is betterwe get to live in a nice place for about 2 years or moreget to be closer to ES and her friends so it's not like were alonewe could start overAnd my reasons for staying are:we don't speak the fucking language we don't have jobs lined upthe country is racist against foreignersi would be moving away from all of my friends and family, including MSwe just moved three years ago and I'd rather not do it again anytime soon, especially not that far.I thought that my reasons were valid and that he would see why this was a dumb idea.Until yesterday, when he told me he was moving to foreign when our lease was up in 2020, with or without me.I asked him why he why he would do this, that it was a stupid idea and he has no way of getting a visa and he wouldn't have the help of ES, he would be on his own to find work and a place to live. And he just said i would rather die a poor man in that country than continue to live here, that he was a broken man who was raped when he was younger, physically and emotionally abused by his family, and bullied his entire school career and life isn't fair that i dealt him the cards that it did, so why not sell his things and die in foreign country.I'm at a loss of what to do, y'all. He tried to kill himself over 5 times since we started dating and has ended up in inpatient once, but nothing has helped. He's on max levels on Zoloft and Wellbutrin, and did therapy since he was young, but nothing has helped. I don't want him to go, not only because i love him but because i don't want him to become homeless, get deported, or worst case scenario, die in a foreign country surrounded by strangers. This is an all around terrible idea, but he says if he can't go, he'll make sure that he succeeds in killing himself because there's nothing else for him to live for. He needs help, but he isnt willing to go to rehab, inpatient, or back to therapy. I could send him to live with his mother, but she's not an understanding person and i feel like it will only make things worse. What do i even do? Kick him out? Send him to rehab? Let him go to foreign country? I'm just honestly at a loss on what to do. Not only do I feel unloved and betrayed, I don't know how to help him.

Perpetual suicidal thoughts, just a general disdain for myself, all that. Im late 20s and I really think this has gone on since I was in middle school.

I\u2019m in control enough to never act on any suicidal thoughts because I just couldn\u2019t do it to my brother, sister, and parents. I love them so much.I never even considered that others in my family might be feeling the same way. My brother (~2 years younger) took his own life via his roommates gun in January.I just don\u2019t know what to do. Like, the feeling of abandonment is just unbearable, the suicidal thoughts are so much worse and paradoxically my will to live is so much stronger than it ever was before now that I just absolutely couldn\u2019t put my sister and parents through this. My parents need so much support right now. Losing a brother is so awful, I can\u2019t imagine losing a son. I\u2019m doing everything I can to stay strong for them and support them.

I think it happened 2 or 3 times, definitely at least two. All the same setting, late at night, relatively decent day, my brother already alseep on the other side of the room. I barely remember how it starts but I distinctly remember what I was thinking. I think it started when I thought to myself that I would write a Reddit post asking for help, not that I'd actually get help from it, just someone to talk my sob stories to. I started writing the post in my head, I knew I would never post it at this point. Instead of coming up with a post asking for help my brain just started listing everything wrong with me and my life, how I'm unattractive, how I'll never find love, how as soon as I get out of school I'll probably be homeless, how it's probably not worth trying anything since climate change is going to destroy civilization in the next 30 years anyways.My brain began to focus on how guilty I was after a while. I don't even know if I was guilty, or that's just what my brain was telling me. It told me how guilty I was for faking depression, and other people have had it so much worse than me and have made it out okay.Suicide began to creep up from a dull thought at the back of my mind like it usually is to the forefront as an easy solution to the problem that was my life. I say I'd never kill myself, but if this happens more often would it life be really preferable to death if every day is like this?I just kept going and going in my head on loop, it would never end. It felt like, and probably was, hours. I knew I wanted to break the circle but I just couldn't. I remember one time it happened more than the other, it was a Wednesday night in January. It was starting to get weaker but wasn't entirely over, what finally broke it was my crush sending me a shitty meme at 3 am. Lol. Now that I look back at it, I can remember what happened before the other time one of these nights happened. I had gotten home from my dad's house and taken a shower and was sitting on the couch in the living room. I felt sort of disconnected and pretty depressed. I kept sending memes from r/2meirl4meirl to my brother and my friends group chat just hoping someone would notice and talk to me. No one did, my brother just complained that I was being \"edgy\". When I laid down in bed my story began.I noticed my depression which wasn't very bad before this got significantly worse afterwards, still not severe though. It's starting to impact my life moderately, I'm losing motivation for school and isolating myself from my friends, although I often tell myself they're isolating themselves from me.

To give the (relatively) short version of the story, I've struggled with mental health throughout most of my life, although up until the past year or two this struggle has been dominated by OCD and anxiety. My senior year of high school and first year of college were great - I was finally on meds and felt like I had conquered my mental instability. I could do my work without obsessing over it, and go through life with less self-scrutiny and general worries. I finally felt normal, and was a very productive, optimistic member of society.Sophomore year of college was a mixed bag. Depression became the new defining feature of my mental health, but every time it flared up my psychiatrist simply upped my medication and I'd feel better for a few months. But 2019 has been a whole different ball game. I've been feeling overwhelmed by my depression - it consumes me and doesn't let go. Some days I stay in bed, watching the sun rise and fall from the protection of my sheets, simply because I don't want/can't motivate myself to face the world. Some days I cry every hour, for many days in a row, for no reason at all. Some days I stare at all the work I have to do, trying to force myself to focus and read it, but unable to get through even the first page.  Some days I see no end to my struggles, and am convinced my miserable life will go on forever.I'm a junior at a good university who was once thriving - in academics, extracurriculars, and even my personal social scene. Now putting on clothes in the morning takes all the effort I can muster. It is deeply saddening for me to see all my hopes and dreams wash away while I sit by, caring too much but, at the same time, not at all. My psychiatrist has had me trying different meds for the past few months, after having done a genetic test and everything, but they aren't seeming to work. I have a good therapist who I see once a week - twice on bad weeks - but the cycle of my depression continues. I'm now worrying that I may never be able to get back to my old self.How do you stay hopeful that you will get better and get back to where you once were?Thanks for listening.~ boldturtle", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "ThatINTJ", "created_utc": 1554782573.0, "body": "I gave up on getting back to where I once was and finding a new stable in the present me, now."}], "created_utc": 1554782177.0, "author": "boldturtle", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bb3ckq/how_did_i_get_here/", "title": "How did I get here?", "id": "bb3ckq", "body": "I just looked up and realized my depression is worse than I thought.

I have depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. I got an ESA cat at college that comes home back and forth over thanksgiving break. She\u2019s almost three years old. Yesterday, I was playing video games with my brother. I was sitting in the recliner, didn\u2019t even think to check under it or anything since our pets are usually well behaved (2 other cats and a dog). This time, I heard kicking and and felt it. I lifted up my chair and saw that I had essentially closed the recliner on my cats head. I began freaking out and screaming for my parents, I heard her shrieking and choking essentially and I\u2019m trying not to burst into tears at this horrific sight. My dad was able to get her free and she seemed a bit disoriented, but she didn\u2019t black out or have any noticeable problems besides her mouth open a bit, shedding, and her eye rolled a bit (like a lazy eye) for a couple minutes after so I got concerned. I called the emergency vet and they told me she was in distress and recommended getting her there immediately. It was an hour away. She calmed down and went back to being mostly normal by the time we arrived. They looked her over and told her she was neurologically fine, but they wanted to run xrays to make sure. They said she\u2019s very healthy, no broken bones or problems. We headed back to school and she\u2019s been normal ever since. Ever since I keep replaying the incident in my head and hear the mortifying shrieks and remember so vividly seeing her stuck and my heart races. I\u2019m so afraid of losing her... I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if something happened to my beloved cat. I have kept her close to me and shown her tons of affection since the accident, even more than before. She seems totally fine right now, but I just can\u2019t get this out of my head... what should I do? I keep having these terrible thoughts about the what if\u2019s and the thoughts of losing her...

Maybe my story can help you.", "id": "bb2v5l", "body": "I decided to share my story in hopes to help others struggling with sadness, depression, or being stuck in your head. I\u2019m gonna try and be as short as possible and get straight to the point. Let me know if you want me to go more in-depth or give details/explanations on something.IF YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW I CONQUERED DEPRESSION SCROLL DOWN TO #1Depression fucking sucks. Being stuck in your head, not being able to be your true self, being unhappy, having no interest in doing anything, no energy... no one seems to relate to you.. no one seems to notice or care about the state your in.. you are at full out war against yourself.Here\u2019s my background real quick (you don\u2019t have to read):: I\u2019m a dude who just barely turned 17y/o (yes I\u2019m still quite young, don\u2019t have much life experience blah blah blah) who battled depression & anxiety for a year and a half. I swear to god the world was against me with shit happening left to right, literally. I was unhappy 24/7, always worrying about something, couldn\u2019t be myself, had no energy, and was CONSTANTLY stuck in my head with negative thoughts and emotions. And honestly it got to the point where I became a bit suicidal. But I would NEVER take action on taking my life.  I\u2019ve seen the consequences from other people taking action around me and that itself is why I did not.I never told anyone of my depression or anxiety. I felt terribly ashamed and fear that I\u2019d look weak, or that no one would understand me. I thought no one could help me with where I was at mentally, and either way I\u2019m very bad at expressing what goes on in my head.Now let\u2019s get into my journey of conquering depression and experiencing a life and state of mind that I thought wasn\u2019t possible.\n***I DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT recommend the use of drugs (mushrooms aren\u2019t even a drug imo), especially if you are in the wrong state of mind or environment. If you are depressed, be very careful with shrooms. Comment below if you want advice on taking magic mushrooms the right & safe way (and most beneficial).\n**if you aren\u2019t familiar with magic mushrooms, please go read up on them and their endless benefits. If you haven\u2019t experienced them, don\u2019t talk shit on them.I hit rock bottom about 6 months ago. Right after, I decided to do some magic mushrooms. At the time, I was very intrigued by psychedelics and their power to open your eyes to life and help depression. So I bought some for me and my 3 best friends, and we headed up the beautiful mountains, set up some hammocks, and took the mushrooms.\nTHIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED MY LIFE, and FOREVER WILL, and I cannot express that loudly enough. I could go on for hours about this experience so I\u2019ll try and keep it as short as possible. Long story short, the shrooms put me in a new state of mind at peace with myself. I escaped my head and negative thoughts, I genuinely felt happy, I realized how selfish I\u2019d been towards others and myself, and I realized the beauty of life and my surroundings. I realized MANY things, things that were contributing to why I was feeling the way I did.\nThis trip instantly changed my life. I didn\u2019t have a \u2018come down\u2019. It literally killed my old way of thinking and feeling, and replaced my mind with a new default. And it lasted.After this experience, I worked on myself, optimizing my life for happiness and just having a purpose sorta say. These next few things I\u2019m going to share are what helped me conquer depression, and I STRONGLY encourage you to try all these things out. Don\u2019t just try them for a few days, try them for at least a month. You will definitely see improvement in your state of being if you actually try, so please, take my advice, and make all of these a habit.Do you have a dream? Everyone does. Whether that\u2019s becoming a millionaire, traveling the world, becoming a famous painter... IM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, IF YOU ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE AND WORK FOR IT. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you differently. When you have a vision, you have a purpose, and when you pursue a purpose, you become happy and self fulfilled. Set goals and discipline your self. This has changed my life greatly as I have a crystal clear vision of where I\u2019m going and what I want to be. STAY HEALTHY\nExercise. Yes, everyone says exercise helps depression. IT REALLY DOES. And EAT HEALTHY! Exercising builds self confidence while eating healthy gives you the motivation and energy to go through life.MEDITATION\nYes, 17y/o dude doing meditation. I cannot express how much meditation has changed my life. This is what helps me control my thoughts. I\u2019m now not stuck in my head, always thinking. I\u2019m living in the moment, and not using energy on my thoughts. When you are not stuck in your head, your able to see and feel life how it\u2019s meant to be, and it\u2019s beautiful.FIND YOUR SANCTUARY\nFind your happy place. The place you feel at peace. For me, this is the beautiful mountains I live next too. Taking a hike let\u2019s me be free of thought, and feel at ease. Mother Nature sucks the bad shit outta me and fills me with peace. Find your sanctuary so that if you are down, you have somewhere to go.BE BUSY, AND AROUND PEOPLE\nDepression starts with thought. Hell, depression is all in your mind. Being alone is VERY LETHAL, if you are prone to feeling depressed. When I realized this, it changed my life. When I\u2019m busy and around others, I don\u2019t think as much. I enjoy what I\u2019m doing and it just keeps me happy. If you are always alone, you WILL get depressed, and it\u2019ll just keep getting worse. GET OUT OF YOUR HOUSE AND DO STUFF!WRITE\nWrite down your goals, thoughts, feelings, how your day went, what you want, what you fear, just WRITE! Write your thoughts down. I can\u2019t tell you why this helps, but it just does. You feel much better after.YOUR MIND\nIn order to be happy, you must train your mind to be happy. See, when you are depressed, your create a pattern for your brain to always be unhappy. In this case you see the worse in everything, you are anxious and fearful, and you are just always thinking negatively. \nBe grateful for your friends and family, the things you have, and that you are just alive. Find good in everything even if something doesn\u2019t go your way. Do not judge others, instead look at how beautiful their soul is, and engage with them positively. Everything you do, just do it in a positive vibe. Create a positive association with your brain on life.These are what helped me most and many more. If you actually want results, actually put in the work. Don\u2019t give up. Life is beautiful. Don\u2019t get caught up in the past or the future. Just enjoy every second as it is, and let it be. Believe it or not, just know that you are in control, and it\u2019s up to you of how you feel and how you think. Optimize today to fee better tomorrow. Getting out of depression is a process, it won\u2019t happen overnight (unless you do shrooms maybe lol).And lastly. You will get out of depression. And once you come out of depression, you will feel like you can take over the world. Depression is fucking tough. It\u2019s fucking hell. Realize that you are up against one of the toughest battles in man kind, the battle against yourself. If you can beat depression and yourself, you can conquer anything.If you made it through this, thank you, and hopefully it all made sense and can benefit you somehow.", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "TastyDate3", "created_utc": 1554784813.0, "body": ">Do you have a dream?

Its been a while since I've actually done anything relevant that I'd probably be fired within weeks for incompetence if i miraculously got a job. \u200bI'm shit at making friends. Life was easier back when you just became friends with whoever you sat next to in class. My old friends from highschool and Uni have moved on now. They're off getting married and buying houses while i'm just left behind doing nothing. Dating? Honestly, I don't even know if I'm Bi, gay, straight or asexual. Half the time i think i have no interest because i believe no one would be interested in me. The concept of that is so strange to me, I wouldn't know what to do with another person. \u200bHonestly its probably only a matter of time before i kill myself. I'm too much of a coward right now, but maybe one day i'll grow a spine. I think about it a lot. I don't think i have much to live for. My family would probably be devastated and maybe thats why i haven't tried. I just keep hoping someone will run a red light and hit me as i walk across the street. \u200bTLDR, just some stupid crywank", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "DrowsyRat", "created_utc": 1554777942.0, "body": "If you're truly dissatisfied with your life, the only way you can go is up.

But I put myself in a situation that typically makes me anxious and came out of it okay, so that's a win in my book.  I have a really bad habit of putting emphasis on everything bad going on in my life, so I'm trying to just write down some of the good things I have in my life, such as friends, the opportunity to go to school, and a stable living situation.  Finally, and this is a really tough one for me, I'm trying to adopt some healthy habits in my life.

I had positive thoughts, made mistakes and learned from them instead of dwelling on them, and put together a plan of action to work on getting better.  I know that there will be hard days in the future, but I hope that continuing to post updates on r/depression and sticking to my plan will give me the tools I need to get better.\u200bPS- I was having some anxiety last night about keeping my previous post from the other night up and was considering deleting it.

I'm pursuing other types of treatment (changing diet and exercise, CBT, hypnotherapy, meditation), but I can't help but feel like it's possible the chemicals in my brain are just out of balance. I did try Zoloft for a few years in high school, but I feel like I wasn't aware enough at the time to really figure out whether or not it helped me. My boyfriend, whose opinion I respect, deeply questions my desire to try antidepressants again because he thinks that drugs might numb my ability to really experience the world and explore my pain so that I can exorcise my demons naturally. He equates using powerful drugs to alter your brain chemistry to \"obtaining wisdom you haven't earned.\"I'm thinking about this, and I find it very difficult to wrap my head around. Does taking a drug to help balance me mean that I'll be dependent on it, or can you use it as a tool to help give yourself a foundation to deal with the issues in a more healthy way?

Besides, he overestimates the effectiveness of antidepressants, because they do not give wisdom and the effect is subtle.  But I might partly agree with him, if he really means that suffering brings about wisdom/strength that you can only \\*earn\\* by suffering (ie: \"embrace the suck\", according to Navy Seals).  The question is, how much suffering should a person have to endure before it's debilitating and damaging?  You've got your work cut out for you, so taking the antidepressant is not a cop-out.  The purpose is to boost you enough to begin real life changes and make them a habit.  (Your BF seems like a deep thinker - respect - but I'm not cutting him slack either.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdeally, taking an antidepressant is like using crutches.  People with an injury who need crutches obviously need them, and nobody debates it.  Now, what's interesting is how long you need the crutches.  A leg injury heals, everyone is glad to start walking normally, and then it's silly to keep using the crutches.  For depression, it's less clear and doctors do not plan for people stopping antidepressants.\n\nAnother analogy for antidepressants is insulin used by diabetics.  It's very rare, but diabetics can stop using insulin with radical diet changes.  I hope antidepressants are easier to stop than insulin, but I'm not sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntidepressants do not replace self-care, social connections, and hard work required to get better and maintain your wellness.  If it gives you a boost, then use it.  (eg; you mentioned withdrawing socially, and it could help there)  I am concerned about long-term use, because there is some evidence that antidepressants can eventually turn pro-depressant (tardive dysphoria).  Antidepressants are a tool, and can help when used with care.  My opinion, from my personal experience.  YMMV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I (40's M) started taking antidepressants in my mid 30's, and used them to function for a while before the effect diminished and my doctor switched me to something else ... and repeat ... repeat....

I expect to be at a crossroads soon, and will have to decide to either stop antidepressants or continue taking them indefinitely (knowing what I know).

Do I know that for sure? No, but I think its a fairly reasonable educated guess. I think its a lot more reasonable than just insisting my perception of reality has been wrong for most of my life. Why is despair less \"real\" than hope? I think sometimes people put too much faith in reality being mostly good. We're told to fall in line with society, always strive for an illusive state of happiness, and not dwell on the uncomfortable truths. Many people will discredit any depressed person's worldview by reducing it to just an illness. Life sucks? Nope, that's not the truth, you're just depressed. Feel that its unfair to be forced to live a life that you didn't consent to in the first place? Clearly you're just saying that because you're in a \"mood\" and surely you'll change your mind later. Some truly awful people will go so far as to discredit even the notion of feeling that way in the first place, calling your emotions childish or weak.I'll grant that all thoughts are not equal. I'd say that serious introspection on the meaning of life generally has more weight than a passing thought of \"I'm stupid, nobody likes me\", for instance Also obviously, I can't claim to know the absolute truth of all things, nor do I suggest that I don't have biased, negative thinking patterns at all. My point is, I think its insulting to just dismiss a person's entire worldview, defined by years of experience.

I'm a 20 year old dude and I already feel like i have nothing to live for. I've struggled with depression and anxiety since i was about 13-14. I have seen therapists in the past and for me at least, paying a stranger to listen to me did absolutely nothing. My parents are great people and they are the only reason I haven't fucking offed myself yet. they don't understand depression even though they have tried listening to me. My parents wouldn't let me go on medication because my sister is severely disabled and because of that, they are strongly against it. I'm 20 now and I suppose i could do it anyways, but I am honestly so scared to try.

I feel like i am 2 different people. Some days I can be very sociable, in a good mood, and other days i cant even brush my teeth. I have plenty of friends, I'm an attractive guy, i have no trouble with getting girlfriends, yet i just don't care. I'm always too anxious/overthinking everything to actually try and make a relationship last. But at the same time I cant get rid of this crippling lonely feeling. I've developed some not so good substance abuse habits (runs in my family) to try and deal with feeling like fucking shit all the time, but obviously in the long run it has made things way fucking worse. I cant even go a single day without getting high or drunk. depression has taken everything out of me. I feel like every day i'm just lying to myself. I feel so guilty for feeling like this all the time when there really is no good reason for it. I almost dropped out of uni this year but just managed to scrape by.  I hide everything because I have never been comfortable with feeling vulnerable (except to strangers on the internet I guess...), and sometimes (too many times) it's just too much, I cant bring myself to eat for days, literally only leave my room for a cigarette or to use the bathroom. why am i like this?

It was just something that I couldn\u2019t relate to and assumed people used it as a cry for help or to get a bit of time off work.  I find it difficult to distinguish between people who have real issues and those who like a bit of attention and drama in their lives but who am I to judge. I\u2019ve never really been a big talker and emotionally completely closed to others.  I\u2019d not cried since I was a young child and didn\u2019t really understand why others got upset at the TV.  It seemed quite absurd to me that others could be affected in such a way they would feel an emotional attachment to pictures on a screen.  Since a young age I\u2019ve not really felt excitement, or real sadness, or any kind of emotions.  People would say how did you feel when you got married or when your children were born and I\u2019d lie and tell them what they\u2019d like to hear and what I\u2019d heard others say.. but the truth was well I felt nothing really.  Probably about a year ago I started having only what I can assume to be off days.  I put it down to a seasonal change as I\u2019m more upbeat during the summer months.. but this time was different as the highs I felt at times were a lot higher, I felt happy, excited, motivated and a lust for life, something I hadn\u2019t really felt for a long long time.  It felt really good and for once I felt like I wasn\u2019t dead inside, but it came with a real negative side and something that scares me.. the very deep dark lows.  I found myself wanting to be alone a lot more, music would have a profound impact on my emotions, and thoughts of hopelessness and escape would take hold frequently.  I wasn\u2019t prepared for how my mood would fluctuate during the day.  I tried to look for any triggers or how I could make changes, was it something I was doing to myself.  Was it to do with the time or day, or the day of the week.  I could be fine for a few days or a few hours and then I would drop into a dark hole and struggle to get out.  I never spoke to anybody about how I feel at time as I think people are judged and can\u2019t relate.  If I was honest and told the truth how low I was actually feeling would they start to question every action and second guess every passing comment.  I also felt a lot of guilt feeling like I have done.  I\u2019ve got a good life with no troubles.  I don\u2019t take drugs and only drink on special occasions... so how do I have the right to feel like I have I would think. At the moment I feel pretty good.

i guess. it wasnt until 9th grade i started using pills like cough and cold, xanax, adderall, and more to help me feel better. i got addicted because i felt outgoing and goofy like i used to be. it was all i ever wanted and those were the things that helped me. but i realized about a year after that i had a problem and i spent 3 months getting myself clean and coping in healthier ways and it was smoking weed. i havent touched pills ever since. this is my 2nd year being clean from them and honestly i feel proud about it. but back to the story.. the last 2 years of my life has been some of the hardest times of my life. i had ran away from my home and lived with friends until the school cop got involved. i had tried overdosing and had to go to the doctors cause of it. ive also seen a counselor back when i was in 9th grade because i got arrested and it was mandatory. ive dropped out of school for couple months and transferred to online school because getting out of my bed started to seem like the hardest thing in the world. as you can tell i sound like i know what to do but truth be told i feel like im running from the reality. ive used video games, diets, tv shows and films, and talking to my bestfriend as methods to cope. i felt like even though i feel so down all the time that at least i know what to do about it. but lately ive been feeling like i have no other choice. my sister and i have this ongoing joke that theres no way im living past 25 because either i wouldve killed myself or died cause of drug abuse. but i dont feel it as a joke anymore and more so as a reality and id rather do it now then later cause i wouldnt want anyone to get even more attached as years go on. its starting to feel like im just a basket case for my family until i grow up and do my thing. even the small things my dad does because he loves me makes me question if hes only doing it cause hes scared that im going to kill myself. i cut all ties with everyone but one person and pretty much rely on my online friends now. i dont use snapchat and leave everyone on delivered, same with texts, deleted my instagram, and anything else you can think of. i just want to be forgotten about. im really good at talking other people out of feeling this type of way because ive been through it my whole life. but i just am at the point where i just dont see the point. i just know that nothing good can actually come out of my life and its better to die young than old and tired. i dont know what to do and honestly i just think i need someone to truly open up to so this is what im trying. im sorry about the long post but im really scared of what i might do. can someone please just help me stop feeling so pathetic and helpless... im also sorry i mumbled a lot i cant read this and edit it because i know im going to want to take it down since i overshared.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554765595.0, "author": "ifwus", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bb0mwl/sports_injury_is_bumming_me_tf_out/", "title": "Sports injury is bumming me tf out", "id": "bb0mwl", "body": "So I tore my acl (its actually a little worse and more complicated then that).

I just turned 20 and for the last few years I've been thinking a lot about my childhood. My life was incredible as a kid. I grew up in a city with everything a child could ever want and I lived in a housing complex full of kids my age. It was the last time I had meaningful friendships in my life. Every friendship since then has felt artificial in comparison. We had our own playground and lots of pathways between houses and alleyways where we could play all kinds of exciting games. School was completely stress free and consisted of goofing off and having fun and I never had tests or homework to worry about. I would wake up every day ecstatic about the day to come and practically run out the door. I miss the pure wonder and joy that engulfed my life at that point. I don't know why everyone my age enjoys having responsibilities so much. The best times of my life where when I had nothing to worry about. I didn't know what a \"job\" was or even knew about the concept of death. All I knew was how soon the ice cream truck would be driving by my house or when it would be warm enough to set up the outdoor pool. Every day was like an exciting adventure that I was the protagonist in. Childhood to me was how I imagine powerful drugs would feel. All my senses were boosted and everything seemed \"cool\" and interesting. The bus stop wasn't just a bus stop and the mall wasn't just a mall. I actually grew up near the 2nd biggest mall in my country and I have so many memories of exploring it as a child. Stopping in a Toys R Us was like winning the lottery and being allowed to pick a toy was like a dream come true. I could go on for days but what I'm trying to say is childhood for me was an incredible experience. I have all kinds of extremely intense nostalgia for those times and I still sometimes visit the place I grew up. If I could sacrifice the rest of my life to relive my childhood I would. No loneliness, stress, or anxiety. Just pure unadulterated fun. td;dr - I had an incredible childhood and I can't stop thinking about it. I miss the times when I had almost zero responsibilities and true friendships. I would give anything to relieve those years of my life.

I am more emotionally and mentally wrecked than ever.", "id": "bb09o9", "body": "I hope this is an okay post for this subreddit. If not, if somebody could guide me toward a more appropriate place to post, I would really appreciate it.I've lurked on Reddit for years; as of now, this post is the only reason I'm even making an account.I've been dealing with depression, OCD, ADHD, and severe general anxiety for years now, all of which typically keep me from opening up to anyone, or just doing anything remotely productive for myself. As far as I'm aware, I just have really low self-esteem and have grown afraid of speaking to people and maintaining relationships over the years. I prefer not to speak to people or bother them, because I always feel like I'd just be inconveniencing/annoying them. I'm afraid to even speak anonymously over the internet, but this is just something I feel I need to open up about at the moment. To be honest, I'm not even sure what I'm doing it for, but I just feel like I need to let my emotions out in some form.I apologize in advance if this ends up being a really poorly-paced, disjointed, pointless, and/or long-winded post, and please bear with me because I tend to overthink when it comes to writing. It's hard for me to write down my thoughts without getting off-track or overly-descriptive, especially for something that's been a very upsetting experience for me. This took me about 2 hours to write up succinctly, but I hope it doesn't come off as too much.My family had had a dog (a black miniature poodle) for about 14 years or so. He meant the world to me, and he made life bearable.\nLast Monday, our typically-lively poodle began his day by throwing up multiple times. He spent the rest of his day laying down on our tiled kitchen floor, instead of any of his beds or dog mattresses.We took him to the vet and, after two days of him lethargically dry-heaving and laying on towels in the kitchen, we were told that he had some sort of problem with his gallbladder (I'm unable to say for sure what exactly the problem was). Even though there were absolutely no signs or symptoms before Monday that we could see, it was apparently something that had been building up for a while.We were told that the best course of action was to put him down. So on Wednesday, that's what we did. My mom, little brother, and I were by his side to the very end, still petting him well after the vet told us that he'd passed.This dog was in our family for the entirety of my teenage years. By all accounts, as a typical lonely teenager, and even now in my early 20s, he was my best friend. I cherished and loved him more than anything.And in two fucking days, we went from playing with him like any other day to mourning over his body. He was a relatively old dog (don't have exact age on me at the moment; at least 14-15 years old), but outside of his somewhat-greying beard, you wouldn't have been able to tell with how spry and excitable he was.I miss him more than anything. I know it's been less than a week, but moreso than usual, I've never felt so empty, worthless, broken, and miserable. I feel completely and utterly alone.\nI've been crying to myself multiple times a day, but I don't want anyone in my family to worry about me so I do it silently or when I'm alone. I also actively avoid doing things that would remind me of him. I always gave him a small piece of my food when I prepared food, so I've been eating as little prepared food as I can. I haven't been able to sleep much since he died, but I've taken to often just trying to sleep on the couch of my basement, because my dog never went down there, as he was always afraid to go down its wooden stairs. I can't bear to think about him, I just miss him so much.I hope this post isn't coming off as too overdramatic, but he had such a tremendous impact on my daily life. If you've lost a close relative or pet, I hope my feelings can resonate with somebody, but I'm seriously beyond devastated that my dog is gone. My family is now missing such a large and important aspect of our daily life, and I'm completely lost on how I personally can possibly move forward. For the past few days, all I've been doing is just going to class, trying to get college work done and listen to music, but it's been getting increasingly harder to concentrate on either.As I said at the beginning, I basically started writing this just to get it off my chest. Since this is my first time actually posting on reddit, I'm not sure about what the odds are that this will even be seen. I don't know if anyone is going to read through it, but I just want it to be out there somewhere for now. Sorry if that's not okay.Tl;dr: My mental health leaves a lot to be desired, and I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. A week ago, my dog very suddenly started to show symptoms of some type of problem with his gallbladder. He had to be put down two days later. I'm full of grief, I feel like I'd lost my only close friend, and I'm in a state of misery that I'm not sure I've ever felt before.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554763507.0, "author": "doglessandalone", "upvote_ratio": 0.99}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bb09go/off_and_pause_button/", "title": "off and pause button", "id": "bb09go", "body": "I just want to pause everything maybe enough time on my own head would make it better but we know it just doesn't work like that..", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554763477.0, "author": "hantuijo", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bb09ee/alcohol_relief/", "title": "Alcohol relief", "id": "bb09ee", "body": "Anyone have also just wanted to take a day off, drink a lot of your favorite alcoholic beverage, cry for a while and then sleep the rest of the day?", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "thatlocalnegro", "created_utc": 1554763537.0, "body": "I do that everyday but with weed so I feel you"}, {"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "mynamegib", "created_utc": 1554765658.0, "body": "I can\u2019t even smoke mary jane anymore so have resorted to my parents vodka, which they now mark how filled it is to stop me from taking it.

It somehow was very hard for me to apply to College and some Jobs but I did it.  Guess what? Every single application got rejected somehow. I completely broke down after this and have been unemployed for over 1.5 years. I didnt go out,  not even to family events of my girlfriend's family. Hell, often not even to those of my own family.My girlfriend of 4 years now never said something bad to me. She didnt break up, she always stood by my side and tried to motivate me in a very kind way. I cannot understand why she did this but she did.I started working recently and it is enough to live. We will move in together in two weeks and I will apply for College and to learn a profession. I am still miserable but at least I now feel like I can make her happy which at least gives me a purpose. I really dont care about anything else and I have nothing that motivates me. If my applications will succeed it is possible things will get better and maybe I will feel normal one day. I am actually motivated to get better when I didnt care at all before, might see a doctor aswell.She truly is the best thing I've ever had and I hope I will be able to make her happy. Suicidal thoughts already almost vanished completely.I am pretty confident nobody will care so sorry for the long, pointless post.

Not sure where to go. Sorry for the way that I am writing this, it's going to be more of a thought stream. Im not happy and Im not sure if I would necessarily label myself as depressed, but I do go through episodes of depression. My biggest issue right now that has more recently begun to seriously affect me is that i have a hard time connecting with other people and i have no friends. Ill be more specific; i have one friend who I'm not always sure i even like very much but i keep him around even if at arms length because he is my one friend. He's been my friend for many years. I am 26 now and have known him since i was maybe 13. It may seem that I am alienating myself from the way i just described this friendship so ill go into some detail. I love him as a friend, care about him, and have found myself there to help him when he's seriously needed me. That said in short he's just a strange person. His strangeness never really was an issue to me until one night when we both tripped on acid together and things got very weird. I don't want to go into much detail as this isn't the point of the post but just to put things into context ill say that he was the aggressor in my bad trip where although nothing physically happened there was this rapey/dominating energy being imposed onto me and the whole thing really opened my eyes about the weird way that he views our relationship. Im trying to move past it but i don't think i can. He still makes me uncomfortable especially when i analyze his words and actions against the deeper parts of him i saw that night.I have another group of \"friends\" who are really like music festival friends essentially. We get along. They invite me out and I appreciate it dearly. I love them as people. But I still feel so alone when Im with them. I feel like I have nothing to talk about with them usually. Theres nothing to connect over except music it seems. Which although music is something I'm dearly passionate about, the areas that we have overlapping taste is a mere fraction of the stuff that Im into. I usually always have a good time with them and i value them greatly, but they also live 2.5 hours away so i don't tend to see them much. I guess Ill tell you guys a bit about myself, I'm going to try and be as honest as I can but I'm sure there will be some bias. Im male, 26. Ive lived on my own since I was 18. I am decently smart I guess. I don't usually feel particularly intelligent but at work I'm assured fairly often that I am. I did graduate college with an associates degree suma cum laude with a gpa of around 3.93. To be fair it wasn't a particularly good college, but good enough I suppose to be considered an accredited university. Im decently attractive, but I guess it depends on who you'd ask. 5'11, 165 lbs.  I have a good job, decent car, I make good money particularly for my age. On paper there's not much wrong with me. I do go to therapy every week. I have of course explained all this to my therapist, and he believes that my biggest issue is that i can't connect with people my age because of my maturity level (when it comes to having my shit together because I am definitely not \"mature\") and because my biggest interests are more intellectual or something. My interests and hobbies: listening to music and going to shows and festivals, I do this very often. Maybe four to six festivals a year of different sizes. Shows oftentimes every other weekend. When Im home I play video games, I read sometimes, I am learning the guitar, I go to the gym about three days a week and weight train, i enjoy learning and am very interested in psychology and philosophy. I also take drugs recreationally. Primarily psychedelics. No opiates, no cigarettes, no uppers. No prescription meds. I think about many things through that lens (not many people do I guess)At work I am well liked. Before anyone offers the suggestion that I should befriend my colleagues, Ill mention that I work in a different state than i live. There is also a huge age gap between myself and my colleagues. One of at least 10 years. My last job had some guy my age and we've been out a good handful of times. But they usually go out without me. When asking my closest friend of that group if there was a reason during a particularly honest conversation, he didn't have one. When I go out, I can usually strike up a conversation with anyone. Im not particularly shy unless we're talking about a pretty girl in which case I crumble. But it's not even pretty girls that I am really after, Im dying for a \"bro\" that's just down to grab beers and play couch co op. Those conversations I do strike up, I have a hard time bridging the gap between acquaintance and friend. Speaking of pretty girls, I do have a tinder. Im pretty successful I would say. I have well over 1000 matches now and comparing that to my other male friends who use tinder i believe that's a lot for a male. I don't really use it to get laid, and if that's specifically what i was after i feel like id be able to get it easily enough. but actually meeting someone and connecting with them and vibing with them is soooooo much more appealing to me. that said, I just have such a hard time finding someone that resonates with me the way i crave. and the last two dates i went on where i was interested in the other person, they really didn't seem very interested in me. So again, finding worthwhile companionship on this front has been very difficult for me too. I guess none of this has really been about ME though so let me attempt to describe myself. I would say I have a good heart. I can be selfish, though I really make attempts to check myself so that I am not acting on anyone else's expense. Im sarcastic, a little cynical maybe, though I care deeply about humanity. Cute animals will have me making the least masculine noises you can think of. if the right song is playing at sunset, i might start crying overtaken by the beauty of it all. I regularly help strangers, give homeless change, etc. I've donated to vetted causes when i had the funds. When i have the money, ill just buy people shit. Like if I wanna invite someone to a show and they don't have the money, ill just take them. Ive paid for damn near 1000$ in tickets for festivals and shows for other people over the years and never wanted anything more than company in return. If you're beating me in a game, ill talk shit the whole way down. I have like an ironic confidence because I'm also the most well versed in self deprecating humor. I try to stay humble. I am grateful for everything good in my life, and often remind myself to be thankful for the experiences I'm having and the things i have. I remind myself often that despite my suffering I am incredibly fortunate in many domains. I don't really know what else to say. \u200bI know this whole post is all over the place. I don't know what to say. Im just spilling all of this in the hopes that someone can give me some insight or if someone can get an impression from what I'm saying here what my problem might be. For the most part as far as i know people seem to share the same nice opinions about me; smart, good looking, cool, chill, etc etc but if all that crap is true, then why do i feel so alone? I have the suspicion that people just aren't being \"real\" with me. because if they are, then Im not sure if i would be going through all this. this isn't a humble brag this is a call for help", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554760207.0, "author": "justalonelyboyyaknow", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bazn6b/blowing_my_knee_apart_and_stopping_sports/", "title": "Blowing my knee apart and stopping sports...", "id": "bazn6b", "body": "Yesterday at the hospital, finding out I tore my acl and lcl... just blows. knowing I won\u2019t be able to be on the football and track team this spring and summer, and not being able to play hockey for my final year in fall/winter because of surgery recovery periods...

I was in therapy and found that most drugs are probably placebo as they didn't help one bit.The number 1 reason why I hate my life, is because adulthood is not enjoyable.As a kid I was loved unconditionally by my parents and was cared for and grew up in a snugly and peaceful environment.I had no sorrows, no pressures, I didn't have to take on any responsibilities and was very happy.I had lots of friends and social interactions were so god damn easy. Everything was simple.We played football and other sports, played video games, went to the movies just hung out, wrestled, play fought with sticks 'n guns. It was heaven.Every vacation was pure paradise. I visited lots of countries. Spain, Turkey, Greece, USA, Mexico, Tunisia, Sri Lanka, Singapore and many of them multiple times.Often times we were 4-6 children on these vacations because our parents were colleagues or friends and everyone just  joined up and stuff was awesome.I realize I lived a good and sheltered life and many non western kids didn't have that opportunity and enjoy adulthood more because they could lift themselves up from poverty.But I already wasn't in poverty. I was at a perfect state of living and then after turning 18 you just get dragged out of that dream violently and are thrown into the real world and left to deal with it yourself.This dark place where no one cares about you, where no one will help you, where no one loves you.Where it's every man for himself.Where it's all about money and how much of it you can earn and contribute to society.It's a meritocracy, devoid of any compassion and humanity. There is no sense of community anymore, the tribes grew too big, humans can only really remember or care for about 150 humans and today most people only can make a living in cities, big tribes with millions of people. People are too busy staying alive aka commuting from one job to the next and are preoccupied with worrying about how to afford this and that and how to pay the rent and student loans etc.Modern Life is too fast, too complex with too much information and without any solidarity. Community is dead.Adults are treated as working slaves and have one purpose only: working their asses off for a very few rich people.The only real joy a normal person can get out of being an adult is having a family.If you don't have that you are truly lost and will never be truly happy.Well, I do not have a real family anymore. I lost all my close childhood friends after turning 18 and leaving school.I live in a 3.5 million city so it's very hard to keep in touch. I have searched every social media site I know for any of my old friends but didn't find any because they weren't even known where I lived in 2009.Or because none used their real names, I don't know.And my parents lost all their friends too because I lost contact to their friends's kids and so that's a very vicious cycle because now we don't talk and meet anymore because our kids don't and now we don't have to join our vacations together and everyone keeps to themselves now and it all went downhill.Anyway, so this meritocracy where it's all about money, only cares about people's skills and interests that can earn lots of money.The sad thing is, that I do not have any such skills or interests.I liked reading books, watching movies, playing video games with my friends. Talking about said movies and books with my friends. Playing sports with my friends. You see were I am going. I never cultivated any interest in something practical, something that earns you top dollar later on. Sadly I am not interested in chemistry, IT, biology, economy, Law or politics.That's why I am so unsuccessful and poor, working shitty short term jobs with shitty pay because I have zero qualification.Nowadays I even hate my prior hobbies because I have no friends to share them with anymore.My only solution to find any remote form of happiness, is to find someone to make a new family.But the time of unconditional love is over, a poor, unsuccessful lazy loser won't find anyone.Sure the kid will love you, but the relationship with your partner depends on your qualities and abilities.And when these aren't there to begin with or fade away over time, then the relationship will too.And I don't want to play the wage slave game to earn some made up currency so I can find someone who will love me for me but only when I have a nice paying job and good social status.I don't want to dedicate my life to some corporation and work 10 hours a day, 5 days in a week, only to come home, do the grocery shopping, do errands, do laundry, do the cooking, do the cleaning, do the dishes and then, after all that,I maybe have enough fee time to brush my teeth before going to bed and sleep the rest of my life away.I want a simpler life. I love nature and survivalism. I want to go back to a more frugal and slower life.I want to build a little wooden house near a forest, hunt and grow my own food.I watch these videos all the time on youtube but I just can't do it.I do not have the money and all that stuff is illegal where I live. You need permits for everything and can't hunt or grow your food because that food wouldn't be up to hygienic/health standards and could get it's way to other people's hands.I can't do it because I have mandatory insurance policies and other taxes to pay, even if I don't want any that crap.You can probably guess what country likes those strict rules and permits for every fucking thing. EWERRYTINK ISS VORBIDDN!My only hope is for a djinn to appear and grant me the wish to be a kid again or change into someone's pet, preferably a dog.Or maybe some VR stuff will come out and let me relive my childhood memories.Or give me 20k so I can leave this shitplace and go to canada and set myself up.\u200bTL;DRI am depressed because life is too complex and strenuous for adults with very little to no joy in between.Adult life is burdened with many many responsibilities, fears and a lot of pressure to even be able to make a living.Society only values how much money you can generate and what you contribute yet gives absolutely nothing back and essentially does not support or care about you.Childhood is the best time of life and you are loved unconditionally and live carefree in a cozy environment.Unconditional love doesn't exist in adulthood, so why is it worth to keep on living when your best time on this planet is already over and it's only going to get much worse in old age?", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 8, "author": "ProNoob47", "created_utc": 1554758224.0, "body": "And one thing that just came to my mind:\n\nModern corporate life is particularly hard on men.\n\nBecause men are expected to be providers and protectors.

I'm homeschooled now but all I do is go to bed really late, wake up at midday, and do pretty much nothing apart from maybe some chores and watch documentaries.\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm faking all that I'm feeling and that I'm being melodramatic but people around me have told me something's wrong. I once saw someone say that if you think you're faking it, you're probably not - maybe that can give you comfort. You deserve attention no matter what, and if you're depressed/suicidal then you deserve to get help and support, so don't listen to what your friend is saying. Maybe ask them to read up on the illness, it could teach them that they're not getting the full picture.\n\nRecently I've started riding my bike when the weather is nice, sometimes a little bit of vitamin D can make your day a bit more bearable. If going outside is too much, you can always just open a window.\n\nYou don't have to go to university straight after school if that's putting you off. If you just have no interest, that's okay too, you'll get by without it. There are so many things you can do from home to make some money. For example, my sister writes subtitles for videos, even though she doesn't get a lot of money, she gets paid and can save up for something nice. I didn't (and still don't) want to get a job because with that comes so many new responsibilities I don't think I could deal with and it would make my anxiety worse too. However, there are small ways to make money in a way you're comfortable, and slowly but surely you can work yourself up to something more 'out there', whether that's working at a till or maybe starting a dog walking service. My ideal job would be like sorting boxes in the stock room; quiet, not many people, good routine. \n\nI struggle with self confidence too. Whether it's my mum or friends that tell me I look nice, it doesn't really mean anything to me because they're just being nice people. Imagining myself with a partner is a joke to me and I'm not yet sure how to overcome that, but hey, we're in it together.

Not only does it make my room look nicer, it also gives me something to focus on - if I have to water my plants that day or move them around to get better lighting, it reminds me to take care of myself too (maybe brush my teeth, have a shower etc.)\n\nIf you need anyone to talk to, I'm here.

Shit was fine, the first like 6 months. Then she flipped a switch randomly and got all nuts on me. Came home one day to her moved out. No warning or anything. Started getting letters from Electric company, and she hadn't paid on her half at all so there's a decent chunk hanging there (they can't shut it off during the winter, and I guess just don't send letters during that time). Left me a week and half to figure out how to find double the rent now. Wasn't able to find it, can't find a roommate replacement.  Temp work started getting rarer and rarer. I do temp work because I don't seem to be able to hold a consistent job down due to the depression progressively worsening in that case, but temp work allowed me to work enough to pay bills but also take a random day or two off if I needed to. Now at it's the point the temp place has like 1 shift a week for me. I've shopped around different temp agencies but nobody has anything available I would be able to do. It's 95% all the same type of work. Certain situations tend to bring panic attacks/anxiety on and I had to stop those shifts cause I kept having panic attacks at work. My therapist and shit and I had started considering disability for the depression/anxiety but that's like a 2 year process even if you get it. I had to cut the seatbelt off of me a few ago because it got stuck in the buckle, and was still trying to figure out how to pay to replace it aanndd I got a seatbelt ticket I sure as shit can't afford to pay. Now I'm sitting in my car in a Walmart parking lot with half my shit ( other half I had to throw out cause I couldn't fit it in my car) unable to find shifts I am capable of doing on E with a half dead phone. Anyone I considered a friend has fallen off the planet within the last two weeks so I know nobody technically. Not even sure how to feel. I partly feel like just resigning to the situation. Any work I do get/when I can donate plasma again, just putting in my car for gas and going back to drugs so I make it through the day. So much shit came crumbling apart at the same time I feel lost in trying to correct it. I already find it difficult as hell to do much to begin with and see I'm just falling back into a deep depression pit, but I almost welcome it this time with encouragement.Any housing service we looked at was a bust. Shelters would probably kill me from the anxiety/panic attacks of that many people crammed in a room. Better off sleeping in my car. If cars weren't so goddamn safe I'd go wrap it around a pole without a seatbelt, but I'd probably exit that situation with even better health somehow but no car.I don't even know.

So as I've struggled with depression and addiction over the years, I did it in my own. Needless to say, at the end of last year I hit a point where if I didn't ask for some kind of help and let the people who love me know how severe it was, I wasn't going to make it to the end of the year. It was the hardest moment in my life, until last night. I don't mean to lower the value of the people in my life who have been there for me, but when you have people who normalized depression, addiction, and trauma, well, they can only help so much. Last night I was at a point where my mind was going down a wormhole where all I could do was cry. In the past I've always turned to self harm. I chose not to. I chose to text a friend and ask him for help. I wrote and rewrote the text over and over again, erasing it because I didn't want to place that \"burden\" on him. All I could think is that he was going to tell me to go fuck off or he didn't want to hear it. He came through. He even met me in person because I told him that I had to get out of the house, and we just stood there and talked for 6 hours. We were in a parking lot of the retail store that we met at until 4 in the morning. It was the first time in a long time that I felt that someone in my life was listening, not just hearing what I was saying, but actually listening. Someone whose job wasn't to listen, but took time to stay and talk with me because he puts value in our friendship. And one of the best parts was he said that I could still talk to him about it. He didn't shy away when I told him about my attempted suicide, the trauma in my childhood, or the abuse in the last couple of years. He hugged me and said that he will always be there to listen. It's hard to ask for help, and even now I question whether I'll ask him for help again or if it was worth asking for help. There have been so many times that the people in my life, the ones who say that they love me, have brushed off my cries for help, that I gave up. It makes me value my friend for what he did for me, he didn't have to talk with me, let alone meet with me, but he chose our friendship, he chose me over sleeping. I cried from being both happy and sad.

So now i see someone once a week and i can tell you, even the slightest, it seems to be helping(I even told my mother i loved her for the first time since i was 12). I dont mean to make this about me but I'm trying to prove to you how difficult it is to open up, yet so relieving. Again good job on mustering up the ability to talk to someone, I think the reason we dont talk to others is because we see it as putting needless burden on others and we start thinking we can do this on our own, but in reality humans are social creatures and we cant live in solitude(whether physically or mentally) and be happy.

Here are a few problems I\u2019ve noticed which undermine all the progress our societies have made in adressing mental health. More importantly these are the things which a lot of people who suffer from depression want to explain, but either don\u2019t have the courage or the appropriate moment to do so. 1) self harm is not a suicide attempt and it also isn\u2019t a hobby - at worst its a bad habit, but it\u2019s never for pleasure.I self harmed once and never again because the circimstances which followed and the 4 physical scars left were a big enough deterrent for me not to do it again, although I consider it at my lowest points. People self harm because it\u2019s a sort of release for extreme emotional pain - it doesn\u2019t mean they do it for pleasure. In fact, someone who self harms doesn\u2019t think all that much about why they do it in the moment. It is not an \u201cemo\u201d thing for pleasure - only probably a very very rare minority self harm for these reasons. But nevertheless whatever the reason, self harm is ALWAYS backed by extreme emotional turmoil. It goes against every instinct to wilfully hurt yourself. For parents reading this, self harm is not a trend. Your child is not just copying it from films, books, or the internet although it is true that media can make self harm seem permissible to someone who is impressionable, and already going through depression. 2) Suicide is never a quick, impulsive decision - it\u2019s often years in the works. In the rare case that it is impulsive, there might be underlying mental illnesses which predispose the person to impulsive behaviour. I think joking about suicide is one of the first and most obvious signs. But there are other much bigger signs to look out for - something I recently noticed are \u201cspending habits\u201d. I notice I live either as if I\u2019m about to move house and can\u2019t keep much in the fridge or leave things lying around, or as if I\u2019m on my last day of holiday in a country with a foreign currency and I\u2019m spending my last few coins and note. Perhaps those two examples are specific to my personal circumstances but in general someone who is feeling suicidal will generally unwilling to invest or commit. 3) Trauma can not be erased and traumas will occupy the mind of a victim for their entire life to varying degrees which will manifest in different ways - all depending on the person. Therapy is helpful, counselling can be helpful to discuss things you don\u2019t want to discuss with friends or family you may have, but most of all the only recovery (not cure) for trauma is to rebuild a life and create enough positive memories to cover up the bad stuff. 4) extremely depressed people think they are a waste of time, and this is one of the biggest reasons they actually might end up wasting other people\u2019s time by pulling \u201cno shows\u201d, not pulling their weight in group commitments, or even backing out of plans they made themselves. This might look selfish on the outside but actually, it\u2019s the opposite. A lot of depressed people think constantly about their value to other people and incorrectly conclude that they are a waste of time and take on a \u201cwhy bother attitude\u201d If anyone has any more, please share", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 8, "author": "_SADBOYS_", "created_utc": 1554763552.0, "body": "Point 4 hits the hardest.

I posted some thing on Myspace (quite a while ago) that would be considered cryptic and emo, but I never really wanted to harm myself, I just wanted to see if people cared about me. People did reach out, and it did help. Over the past year, things have unraveled tremendously. I do know that other people have it worse of than I do, and I feel bad for, well, feeling bad. But between a financial crisis, self image crisis, employment crisis, and relationship crisis, things never looked worse. If it weren't for the few friends i have, I might be homeless, and I'm thankful for that\n I do know that if I were in that situation, I have people to turn to. However, I also can't see things getting much better for me. I was in a long term relationship that ended poorly and left me with loads of debt, my position got moved to a building 30 miles further than I used to travel for work and my hours got cut, so I'm struggling badly financially. My car died at only 70k miles and the dealerships are just trying to screw me. Lately I've been wondering if it's everyrthing is fixable, or even worth it at all.The difference now is, I dont want people to know. I'm not posting things and asking for attention on social media. I'm just waiting for the right moment. I used to love helping people, I loved to volunteer and make people happy. Over the last few months, I've become very indifferent about the world. I've noticed that I feel less for other people as well as myself. I dont like it, but I cant help it. I guess the point is, I have been through a phase where I threatened suicide for attention. Now I think it's real, and I can tell the difference. I can tell that I really don't care what happens and I dont need people to know. I know it sounds weird posting this to reddit, but maybe other people feel the same, and maybe they can get help. I'm not looking for help, I don't want therapy, and I don't want pitty. I needed things to fall my way, and i needed friends and support before I got here. I have 2 plans, one which would be at the end of this month, the other in September.

When I stay in and away from the outside world, I get real comfy, but then having to leave to buy groceries, petrol, go to appointments, etc,, becomes very difficult.I don't travel as I once did and I (of course) have lost a vast amount of interest in doing things that I enjoy.Last Friday the blues hit hard !

If I'm going to die, why not fill my days with some things that I like?  If I'm going to die pretty soon, then it's time to do things or at least attempt to.So Saturday night I used up one of my new cannabis disposable pens and went on Groupon.  Long story short, I ended up buying 18 things off Groupon.  My bank contacted me about possible fraud. Nope, just me trying to to kill myself.I bought massages (7-8), other self care things (4-5), car detailing ( to force myself to take all the junk out of the car...it reveals too much that the driver, me, is depressed) and some items that I intend to give as gifts this December ( with the idea that I would then be forced to at live until the end of the year as I'm excited about giving these PERFECT gifts).

It\u2019s never ending, stressful and there is no end in sight to their constant bickering.As step-children I\u2019ve done my best, despite not being a paternal man, to offer help, support and guidance as best I can but it never seems enough or appreciated.Certainly when the boot is on the other foot and I would appreciate their help, or even just their ear, they are nowhere to be seen.I\u2019ve been through some pretty horrendous times over the last decade or so and they have never so much as asked over my wellbeing.The one ray of light is our granddaughter, Ellie, who is an absolute joy. However, she\u2019s now being used by her mother as a weapon against us both and it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking!The level of hypocrisy and two-faced backstabbing has to be witnessed to be believed! Jeremy Kyle would have a field day - thankfully I have more class, the same cannot be said for the rest of them! I\u2019m ashamed to be associated.I do identify with one of my step-daughters it has to be said as I see a lot of myself in her but at the end of the day it\u2019s tough as I always appear to be taking sides.The main way of escaping this stress has, I\u2019m ashamed to say it, been through drink and especially red wine. This \u201csolution\u201d, however, as most others will tell you, simply masks the issue and brings with it more woes - constant grogginess and an inability to concentrate at work are just a couple of the negative impacts to my wellbeing.It\u2019s ruining my health and I\u2019m clearly borderline alcoholic. This is not helping, obviously, and affecting my relationship and work.My relationship, as a consequence of the above, has become numb and lacking in excitement and intimacy and it worries me. We never do anything together and seem to have less and less in common - really worrying!When we are intimate it does seem as if we\u2019re just going through the motions with the odd spark of the original passion that brought us together in the first place (showing that there is hope).The use of fantasies does help but, as with the wine, it\u2019s just masking the fact that we\u2019re both stressed and frankly not really interested in one another most of the time.The fact that we don\u2019t see eye to eye regarding family or money, see below, is putting us under immense strain (at least that\u2019s how I feel).But.....I love her with all my heart!!! I take a lot of responsibility for the state of it - but not 100%.Money is a constant source of stress and frustration with both of us failing miserably to budget correctly and having to constantly rely on payday loans to make ends meet.We both seem totally unable to tighten our belts and be responsible and, as you can imagine, this has an effect on all of the above.Work has, generally speaking, been the one saviour, if you can call it that, in my sorry excuse of a life.It brings in an excellent and regular source of income, without which we\u2019d be in a significantly bigger mess than we are presently.The routine helps as well and, despite not always being able to focus and do my best, my work does appear to be appreciated and my contribution to the team valued.Work is the one place at the moment where I feel alive and happy. This is also sad.It\u2019s not all plain sailing though. My home and personal life is having a negative impact.I\u2019ve had a few occasions over the past year where I\u2019ve taken time off with stress, depression and anxiety and this then manifests itself in guilt and paranoia on my return. It\u2019s an uncomfortable position to be in.All of the above combines to bring my self-esteem to an all time low.I\u2019m fat, unhealthy and, after being comfortable in my own skin for a considerable amount of time, I can honestly say I hate being me!The mirror is most certainly my worst enemy. The same could almost be said of just about everyone else I come into contact with due to high levels of self loathing and paranoia.I see others enjoying their lives, socialising and planning trips and adventures but just see no way to even consider being like them - as much as I would want to.I feel trapped in my own head with no way to get out - it is not a pleasant place to be.I can\u2019t talk to my wife, she doesn\u2019t totally get how I feel although she does always try to be supportive and has been through tough times herself, but ultimately it\u2019s too easy to over simplify the issue and gloss over the top.I can\u2019t talk to my daughter - it\u2019s not her problem and she has university to focus on - I don\u2019t believe a parent should ever burden their kids with their issues.I can\u2019t talk to work, it\u2019s not their problem either and I worry it would affect my position and make me appear unprofessional.Friends? I don\u2019t have any...so not an option. This, I feel, is the saddest part of all as the lack of close friends has been most of my own making and seems like an impossible task to undo.I feel so lonely and isolated that I frankly don\u2019t see the point in carrying on - though that is clearly selfish for the two people who do depend on me.I\u2019m totally out of control and I don\u2019t know what to do.I know I can have a bright, happy future but, and it\u2019s a big but, a lot needs to change - both myself and others around me!", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554751513.0, "author": "eldunbaro", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/baxww1/if_u_ever_went_to_mental_trauma/", "title": "If u ever went to mental trauma", "id": "baxww1", "body": "Anybody here has a break down followed by flashbacks of a particular incident which caused trauma.

I can\u2019t go bake a cake or pull out a canvas and start painting at midnight because I have school in seven hours and work right after. I need rest. I end up watching YouTube or self deprecating until I fall asleep. \nPeople also seem to ignore the fact that people lose interest in their hobbies as time goes on. I no longer draw or paint, reading isn\u2019t the same, and I can\u2019t play an instrument without self deprecating. I\u2019m running out of coping skills and I can\u2019t find any new ones. \nSo basically, I\u2019m supposed to distract myself all day by being too busy to think about being depressed while also dealing with the fact that I\u2019m running out of things to distract myself with. \nI\u2019m just tired of being asked if I use my coping skills at therapy.

I've been on and off different meds for depression and anxiety since high school. Through high school and most of college I was on SSRIs, I think just Paxil and Lexapro. When I graduated and moved I stopped taking them and went a while with no meds. My depression/anxiety came back after a while and I found a psychiatrist my insurance accepted. This doctor had me get a DNA test which showed her which meds might work better for me than others. Pristiq was one of the only ones in the green column, so I ended up taking that which worked well for me. I was on it for around 6 years when it felt like it just stopped working. So I ended up going med free again to just test the waters and see if how I would do with just therapy.\n\u00a0It didn't end up working so I went to another psychiatrist closer to my house. She was very nice and asked what I had taken before, and I told her everything I mentioned above. She decided to put me on a 5mg sample of Trintellix, a newer drug that works different from SSRIs and SNRIs. 5mg didn't do anything other than make me nauseous so she bumped me up to 10mg. Still nothing, up to 15mg. Nothing. Went to 20mg and started getting stomach issues and sexual side effects, but no changes in depression or anxiety. Her response to that was to drop me down to 15mg and add in Rexulti. And she said if that didn't work we'd try Vibryyd, another newer name branch drug.\n\u00a0My insurance only partially covers Trintellix, Rexulti, and Vibryyd so I'd still be paying over a hundred dollars. I told her this. I took meds in the past that worked for me at the time. I told her this. Yet she continually insists on me trying this name brand drug I can't afford just to see if it works. She doesn't want to put me on an SSRI because \"if you stopped taking them then they must not have been working.\" The thing that really got me was when she said they were low on Trintellix samples and pulled out her phone to personally text the rep who she referred to by name to bring more. That combined with her insistence on me trying an expensive drug that does not work for me makes me think she is getting kickbacks from these companies. Has anyone ever run into anything like this before? Should I ask for a different provider or just find a different place to go entirely?

This caused her to be in and out of work over the last six months, and now at the advice of her psychologist and psychatrist, she has applied for disability, because her short term is about to expire.  This has crushed her even more, because she worked very hard to earn the title of director at her job, which she has now given up. There is no telling just how long or when she'll actually get approved for disability, so that will leave us with just my income which is going to be incredibly hard. \u200bMy own job is incredibly unstable, as we continue to lose staff.

Will respond tho.I'm a guy, 17 years. Today, I went to the city to a shopping centre with my brother. I told him at one point I'd go to the toilets of that shopping centre to do the #2.I had gone in the second stall from the left. No one was in the left and right ones. So I just do my business, and at some point, I notice something flash in my right eye. I looked up and saw a small, circular mirror. And through it, I could barely see an older guy wearing a pair of glasses and gray hair, looking at me. I couldn't really see anything else, because as soon as I looked at the mirror, the guy took it away and pretended he flushed the toilet and left the stall.I quickly texted my older brother to come and help, because I was starting to panic and my heart was racing, and I waited for him in the stall. Something like that has never ever happened to me. He did come and I told him about it once we left the hall of the toilet area. As I was telling my brother about the incident in front of the hall, an older guy in his sixties came out, which to some degree fitted the description. I stared at him and he walked away.\nNot even 10 seconds later from a distance of about 10 metres, I see him look at me and look away, three times, then he walked off.\nSo we decided to follow the guy and he seemed to be hiding from us.What gave it away that it was him, was when he was looking at a real estate sign and went behind it (it was in the middle of the shopping centre) and then once he wanted to come back around, he was us looking at him and went right back around. He was walking in a nonsense pattern too. He tried to look innocent, but it didn't work.\nAfter that, we follow him for 10 minutes and he disappeared in a crowd of people.Yes, I did try and go to the security, but my brother refused to go, as he \"didn't want to stay in the SC for any longer\" and made me go home with him. I feel utterly disgusting and really embarrassed that this happened to me and I don't know how to react at this point.I'm not looking for pity here.

The girl I had a crush on rejected me because she is the forbidden fruit and wanted to focus on her life, or she just made that up to be nice and didn't like me for whatever reason, and my former female friend probably hates my guts now and does not talk to me anymore because I ignored her interest over another girl who I barely knew and she rightfully perceived this as rude. I did not intend to be rude to her, and looking back I would have asked her out in a heartbeat. Like a complete idiot, I fucked up and lost a chance at my first attractive, cool, and smart GF in addition to losing her as a friend because I'm an awkward weirdo who got so fixated on one girl who did not reciprocate my feelings that I could not see what was right in front of me, and now I may never get the chance again. \n\nI cannot relate properly to women because of my awkwardness, low self-esteem, and possible undiagnosed Aspergers syndrome, In addition to the fact that I am dealing with severe depression fatigue, and debilitating brain fog for some reason which  my doctor can't seem to figure out conclusively, so I will probably be a loner and virgin for a while, at least until I hopefully get better from my illnesses so no dating for now.

Met on the Tuesday, talked all through the week just fine, until I wished her goodnight on the Sunday, before she cracked and kicked off at me, calling me, 'too clingy, demanding of attention', and her being, 'unable to trust me', and told me not to contact her again.

But a friend of mine recommended a book by Thicht Nat Haan called \"Being Peace.\"\nI suck at quoting, so the short and skinny of it was a part where he talked about people doing things we perceive as evil because they themselves are lacking something in their lives. I'm still working on it, and I still have very cruel thoughts, but sometimes people dont mean harm. Or do mean to, because they are hurting or empty, or maybe just dont see it as wrong, just because you do. I'm sorry if this doesnt help you any, but I dont think YOU are a problem. I disagree with the thought process you and I both share. Of you want to change it, I believe you can, but like all things it will take work. You have different obstacles from everyone else, so your journey will be different. I hope you find peace my friend.

Now it drains me. Just thinking about the sheer amount of times I have fallen on my journey the past few years. Every time I stand up I seem to have less and less energy to fight. Lately I have been feeling stuck. This feeling of a complete bind. As if I have physical chains all over my body chaining me to the ground. No matter how hard I try to get up, no matter how hard I try to change my circumstance, the sheer weight of thick metal brings me right down. Stuck habits I feel stuck to my habits. Gaming excessively has always been my escape, and always leaves me feeling drained and demotivated. Masturbation I've tried to end this habit for  years. I hate how it feels I hate how it leaves me drained and unfocused, but I'm still doing it. Despite enormous effort to quit and replace, I am still witn these habits.Stuck lifestyle I feel stuck to my lifestyle. Despite trying to get myself out of the house despite trying to take responsibility for my finances I still am in the same place--my room, most of the time. Being broke.  Being stuck in the same situation. My job is ok and I am grateful for it. But its not what I want to do with my life. I have taken steps to build my business and make money on my own terms. For that I am grateful. Yet so much work has been put in. And so little has come out of it. Its demotivating. Stuck relationships/intimacy At 27 living in LA doesnt help. I try to go out with friends, date on line, chat random girls when I go out and about. But at the end of the day i always come home alone feeling lonely. Going out to bars is just down right exhausting for me, with rude dudes trying to prove themselves, and most girls being rude and on guard as well. So I tried dating apps, some of my friends have had success with them. But they're incredibly time consuming and they just feel so wrong to me. It's like you're shopping for a product. Feels so superficial and shallow. UghStuck with no future I think the scariest thing is that before, at earlier steps in my life I could close my eyes and imagine a better future for myself toward which I could work toward. But I can't do that anymore. Everytime I close my eyes it's just broken thoughts, heavy feelings. I dont know what I'm fighting for anymore.

Ill let you judge and Ill post some of my renders Ive done which each of em takes about 20-50 hours depending on how detailed it is. And now i cant look at my parents faces and the false hope ive given them. And ive tried posting on social medias and got no thoughts and ideas for my renders. No one gives a sh*t or cares for real hard work. And i see people who sit on their ass and play games and get applauded as if its something to put up on the wall. I'm tired now, and Ive grown weak.

I have aspergers, or whatever they call it now, if that helps you understand my situation any better. Right now feels like a rare time i can think with any clarity, it might be the alcohol, all else is just some mess of rage and emotions I don'd know how to process. There's a lot of crushing things that have lead up to this, really bad breakups, loss of friends, and just two weeks ago the loss of the only person i could tryuly call a friend, and the only best friend ive ever had, I went ot his funeral sunday, and say his body for the last time a week before, i still feel his cold shoulder on my hand where i last touched him then, i often have dreams where he's back and i tough him on the shoulder then wake up. After the funeral I broke the rearview mirror and put a few dents in the car of a past friend that i deemed wronged me. The only thing they did was treat my problems post a breakup as meaninngless and treated it like it didn't matter. to you and everyone else ive told that sounds dull, but to me it was amazingly important that they be my friends through that incredibly rough time. I'm going to court against them soom i don't know when. I just hate them, and i often wish i did more to their car, and at my worst times i want to hurt them physically , somehing i wish to avoid as i dont want to hurt them like that. My faminly's never been really supportive in my emotions, not for lack of trying, but when i was a kid i had a lot of anger issues, that might be holding them back from approaching me now since im a lot bigger, more fit, making me more dangerous. their nervousness to aprroach me may also come from a lack of understanding, and i understand its not entirely their fault. I just wish they'd try to see me more, or give me more attention, with them not, and my friend dying, and my other friends abandoning me due to the madness im going through i feel incredibly alone. the only constant i have really is my dog, beatrice, and shee tends to shy away whenever i get mad around my house. My worry of me coming insane is because often when im in a state of rage either through thoughts of things i hate ramdomly apearing or just general feelings of being laone, all i can do is laugh and scream. i just walk around my house laughing hysterically, i can't control when it happens and when im in it i dont want to stop. I really dont want to hurt anyone, seriously, but when ever im like that all i can think about its getting in my car and destroying all the people that i think wronged me, ex girlfriends, ex friends, just anyone i hate, as if endeing them would fix and relieve me of the hatred i feel. i honestly dont want to hate anymore, i hate that feeling so much. I really don't know what to do, and often dont know how to feel a lot of the time, i partially blame that on the aspergers.

And that's better left to her therapists and psychiatrists anyway. Instead, I'd like to try to explain some things about depression and how you personally might be able to help her. \n\nDepression gives people a warped view of the world and themselves. Even when we know we need help, we have a hard time asking for it. Often we know what we need to do to feel better, and we are ashamed that it's so difficult. There doesn't have to be a specific reason that we feel bad or out of control. Depression is an illness and it takes over our brain. When it's bad it's like we're just helplessly watching someone else crashing and burning. So we're sad and ashamed of being depressed, and those feelings all feed on each other.\n\nSo first of all blaming her is useless and pointless. She already feels guilty. People blaming themselves, like your mom, is also useless. It's not her fault, it's not anyone's fault. You wouldn't blame yourself if she had a physical disease, and this should be treated the same way. \n\nSecond, help her to feel like she's doing everything she can to help herself. Mostly this is taking her meds as prescribed and going to all her therapy appointments. Make sure she actually likes and trusts her therapist. \n\nSomething else you can try that is a little more work is having her make a list of things that help her while she's in a depressive episode. Wait until she's having a good day to talk her about this. Some examples would be taking a shower, drinking water, listening to happy or soothing music. If she wants you to, you can can remind her of these things when you see her struggling. Don't be hurt if she doesn't jump to do it though. The list should be revised as she learn what actually works and what doesn't. \n\nFinally, work on your own toxicity. I guarantee that if you know it's there she is definitely picking up on it as well, and it will only drive her deeper into herself. Coming to a place like this is a good start. Try reading about depression from the point of view of people who have it. There are also a lot resources for SOs of people with mental illness, which I know does fit you exactly, but most of the advice should be relevant."}, {"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "NewbornDawgie", "created_utc": 1554742459.0, "body": "Thank you very much for being so understanding despite my attitude.

Its called Okoshiyasu, Chitose-chan (\u304a\u3053\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3001\u3061\u3068\u305b\u3061\u3083\u3093)\u00a0\n\nyeah I think I overcame like my depression actually you know what I wouldn't say I overcame it probably it's manageable. I do have some tough days. But I think what helps is to have that support. I'm lucky like very lucky to have my amazing husband. He sticks by me he listens to my rants my cries my frustrations. I take a lot of my anger and pain out on him and he doesn't deserve that.

My parents didn't want me to get married or move out on my own, or get a job because I needed to be right next to them so I could take care of them.

I feel like a passer by in everybody else's life. Like an extra in a movie. Like a side-character in a video game. You get the point. I feel like a ghost lingering in this Earth, not because I want to or because I had a choice, but because of obligation and the simple fact that it's all I know. I go to school to be miserable. I'll either fail and be miserable, or pass and have to continue schooling and continue being miserable. I either drop out of college and be miserable, or I somehow graduate just for a small chance to achieve my dreams, which will most likely ultimately end with me being miserable, poor, and/or homeless or living with my parents and being a loser. It all comes back to being miserable, though. So, what's the goddamn point? Nobody will ever love me or give me a chance, I'll never achieve my dream of being a professional musician for a living, I'll never have children, and I'll die sad, regretful, and alone. What's the point. What's the goddamn point. What's. The. Point. Nothing matters. Nothing is built to last. So what is the point of trying? I'll die one day anyways, nobody remembering me or caring about my passing. Life seems so meaningless. Like an empty husk of what life could've been if I were happy, and if I had somebody who loved me, and if people liked me. What's wrong with me? Why must I be so goddamn weird and insufferable and below average that nobody likes me? I try to damn hard to change that. I try different looks, different mannerisms, different ways to approach things and people. Nothing works out. I'm too different from everybody at my school. Why did I have to be the outcast of the outcasts? I wish I were normal. All I want is to be normal. For people to like me for who I am. For somebody to love me for who I am. To be able to make music and inspire people and earn a livable wage. I don't care about material luxuries. I'd be happy having the bare minimum, as long as I could make music for people and live off of it, and have somebody who loves me. Am I selfish? Perhaps I am, but I feel like that's not something completely unrealistic. I don't know. I'm just a dumb teenager. My opinion doesn't matter. Many people where I live and even on this subreddit both made sure I knew that. I'm worthless, talentless, unlovable, undesirable, ugly, and more, and I'll only end up a failure, just like my goddamn father. I hate my life. I hate myself. I wish I wasn't afraid to die.

I woke up yesterday feeling low, but made myself get out of bed, eat breakfast (cold pizza) and take a shower.  I ended up crying and I can't figure out why I was, there aren't usually thoughts in my head that I am aware of, only the feelings.  But again I cried it out on my husband and finished getting ready.I planted some things that I picked out the day before in my garden, to help relax me.  Then my friend arrived and off we went.  I wasn't enjoying myself at all, and I used to love going to the fabric store and getting inspiration, I just couldn't this time.  It was horrible, he would ask questions, and sometimes I could answer, but kept the answers short.  I don't think he knew what was going on with me, I just wasn't in it.  But I kept going because I wanted to beat depression and try to live my life.We got home and I started to show him how to use the sewing machine for a pillowcase he wanted to make.  While he was sewing, I felt stiff and uncertain/uneasy, like I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  During dinner everything crashed into me.  He saw it and asked if I was ok, I said I was dealing with my brain and he asked if I wanted to be alone.  That it was ok for me to run to another room and sob into my husband.  I couldn't even speak to say what was wrong.  I was almost hyperventilating, I was starting to get a headache and my eyes hurt from crying so hard.My friend left shortly afterwards, he was really nice and understood.  I felt defeated because I wanted that day to be a fun day, and the entire time I didn't have any fun.  I just staying in my bedroom, hugging my teddy bear, and watching Netflix.This morning I feel low again, almost like an emotional hangover.

I have my own interests but I don't seem to have the ability to plan and work towards my goals. Going to an office job with 2 hours of commute and 8 hours of work burnt the hell out of me so fast.I read about how many cities and settlements in the older world used to have beautiful architectures. I've also seen a video about how the dull greyness of cities affects our mood. I'm in a relatively shittier country so it's unorganized and trashy in so many places.Last but not least money. I have never felt financial security in my life. I'm also terrible with money and I'm aware of it. I have made some terrible choices which have put me in the worst situation of my life. My family spent money they didn't have and it's affected me too.I don't feel like this is how humans are supposed to live.

I've lurked for years, but this is my first time posting.   Some events from my past recently came back into my life. Even though I am no longer the same person I was back then, I have lost all friends. I've lost my girlfriend of almost 3 years. My image is tainted, so I can no longer do what I enjoy making without backlash: music. My peers have also jumped ship, so here I am. Alone. Trying to find some sort of connection amongst strangers on the internet.   I dunno, maybe I'll find what I'm looking for here. Maybe I won't.  For the past week, I've felt nothing but emptiness. I can no longer eat or sleep.   Yesterday I made the conscious decision to purchase supplies to end it or whatever.

Please let me know if I am breaking any rules for the posts, not entirely in the most stable place right now. Accordingly, please ignore any slapdash spelling or grammatical mistakes.I am a 26 y/o white man. Raised solidly upper middle class, well educated, devoted leftist, so on and so forth. 6'2'', moderately handsome. In a long-term relationship with a lovely little dog and a cute affordable house. That fact makes me feel awful insofar as I have been dealt a full deck of cards - never oppressed, never discriminated against. However, I've been depressed my entire adult life. Last week I absolutely cracked.I graduated from a very prestigious liberal arts college a couple of years ago with a degree in Philosophy. I initially wanted to go to law school, but after working as a paralegal for a couple of years, I realized it was not for me. Last October, I went to a Coding Bootcamp and took out close to $10,000 in loans for it.I was offered two jobs, one full-time at a company that i loved, and other contract job that payed about $1,000 a month more. But I didn't love the company or the culture. I took the latter deal in an effort to quickly pay off my loans and since the recruiter was some frat-boy asshole who essentially coerced me into signing the documentation. I now realize how horrid of a decision that was. Soon, I started dreaming of the other employers' faces, I starting drinking as soon as I woke up in the morning and I quit sleeping. I constantly think of how much happier I would have been at the other company.I began punching my leg until it bruised, compulsively masturbating to get some form of pleasure followed by showering and spent an hour on the phone with a counselor at a local suicide hotline. I know this is the most privileged thing in the world to complain about, but I literally cannot fucking stop panicking. And I feel doubly remorseful knowing that there are homeless people right outside my office space, as I shouldn't be complaining about the opportunities I have received. I now feel as if I should be institutionalized, or committed. I'm lashing out at my partner and self-harming. I have smoked four packs of cigarettes (I quit a while ago) in the past two days. I entered a state of paranoia and psychosis from the anxiety. Not to mention, I considered calling my relationship off with my partner of over 5 years because I am convinced she deserved better than me. Bless her, she's been trying her damned fucking best to get me out of it (taking me to plays and lectures) but I cannot manage any form of escapism.I have been dealing with depression, anxiety, and OCD for years upon years now. But I am spiraling out control. Into my early twenties I had an internal mantra saying 'I hate myself' and 'I want to die'. I never really took those seriously until now.\u200bTLDR; Privileged white man goes insane over having too many options to advance his career.", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "VenomRek", "created_utc": 1554732816.0, "body": "Stay with your girlfriend please. it's all she wants, is you and you're good enough for her, trust me. if you love her, you won't let her go.

Yeah being 20 something and not having any real job, or even a proper part-time job experience is enough to give anyone anxiety, but every single day I literally can't do anything.\u200bI try to read - I can't concentrate, can't focus on the book.I try to watch something on Netflix - Same as book, I cannot enjoy anything. Imagine watching a movie with someone holding a gun to your head, who will shoot if you ever scream during the movie.I try to draw(something I loved to do) - I don't know what to draw, I can't think of anything interesting.I try to play guitar -  I get bored. I used to love playing guitar so much that during high school, all I ever thought about was guitar, 24/7.I try to play some game - I can't relax enough to enjoy anything story-driven, which I love, so I'm just playing Payday2 while wanting to play Alan Wake. Maybe I'll try playing the Sims4, but that is too boring so I start thinking then become nervous.I try to get out and ride some bicycle - I either don't go out at all or just ride around for 30 mins and come back bored.I think about socializing - Then I realize my options are limited and what's left is not available in my area. I wish there was 'social phobia/anxiety get-together' thing.I think about 'exploring' the city I live in - there is nothing to see and I can't afford to spend money as I don't have an income. I just want to randomly book an airplane ticket to Iceland or Alaska or anywhere quiet and different from everything I experienced - Lol it's expensive...\u200bSo all those above are impossible, I can't find peace even in some places I found close to where I live, there is this small stream where I can see fish and snails. I just can't anymore. I go to that quiet bicycle-road and just stop and find peace watching the big river that flows through my city (the only thing closest to being worthy to watch). I can't.\u200bMy muscles are so tense, and my legs won't stop doing that repetitive up-down thing many ppl do.Except mine is violent and it's enough to make my legs tired.\u200bThe only option is the meds prescribed by my doctor. I try my best to take as recommended, but 0.5 mg of xanax doesn't do anything. I took 1mg an hour ago and nothing's happening.\u200bAnd the whole day today, I did: go look at my old tweets and random facebook pages for no reason/learn about a musician I just discovered/watch my youtube favorite list. That's literally it.The only real thing I did during the last couple weeks is that took some internationally-accepted English exam (English isn't my 1st language) similar to TOEFL, with next to no preparation. I didn't even know what the questions would be like. But thanks to my experience at the states for 2 separate periods in the most important turning points of childhood, I'm more comfortable with English compared to the most, so got a decent score to apply for some programs for college graduates.*At the expense of:When I returned as a 2nd grade, I found my 1st language a bit confusing so kids teased me for being 'stupid'.  I became that silent mute weird kid, terrified to even make a sound. I got severely bullied for being that way. I got OCD and got obsessed with washing my hands and a certain number, and keeping things on my desk in order. My parents never took me to a doctor because I live in a developing country, psychiatry is still unfamiliar to people here. I almost hate my parents for it. Some of my elementary teachers actually called my mother to say some concerns about me being mute. Mother laughed it off as me being shy and nothing serious happened, nor did she talk about it. Naturally, I get into my own headspace, and go on internet to see all these hilarious memes and jokes I want to share. But most people here cannot understand humor in English, and don't even find them funny. It's like being in a culture shock in my own culture, I can't share my love of gaming. \u200bSome people look at me weird just because I have short hair as a female.I know LGBTQ issues are everywhere, but many countries, 'official' or 'the right moral' is to not discriminate queer people. Although it's just for marketing in most cases, many shops show their support either subtly or really openly. Here? Nope. Although it is not 'illegal' like that Brunei guy, same-sex relationship is seen with disgust even with young people, maybe in part due to culture. I try to seek support groups, but they literally hide their locations/websites cuz some hate-filled people hack the website or physically come to the office or something and chant something about anal, jesus, god, etc. Queer support group's office door become covered in hateful words, the flag or a hanging banner simply welcoming freshmens in college, gets ripped overnight by a professor. And the school does nothing of it. So they do things by word-of-mouth and I am not social enough to be in that network.\u200bI try to do something but I'm too nervous and tense to do anythingI do know the dangers of benzo dependence, so I set a max amount per day and try not to go over that. It used to be 2mg, but I changed to a local clinic from a univ. hospital because it was cheaper and closer in distance. The local clinic doctor just reduces to to 1mg/day ignoring all my fact-based explanations. She simply says 'this is a small clinic, so I cannot prescribe you that much' mentioning something about not being able to take responsibility.Everything is fucked and am I shadowbanned or something from r/depression? I don't know what exactly shadowban is but the user doesn't know they're invisible?

I remember leaving Uni and it is 90% feeling like useless pond-scum, 10% hoping a job will land. I got real fucking lucky and landed a job not because of my skill but because the person before me was crap and they needed someone fast. Sitting in limbo sucks for the soul because in the depression you seem to be going through, you become entirely disassociated with -everything-. It is ok to feel this way, you aren't full of shit, and head-space is just as important as any meds you may take. It is tough. Breaking the mould isn't easy either if you are stuck without money it is a catch 22, and at the same time, everything boring you makes you feel even more stuck. Take it day by day, set yourself something new if you can. Maybe turn your daily cycle into somewhere new. Check out local trails and take pictures. Give yourself time when you need it, and although thinking positively can be insanely stressful and crap, any small movement is movement.

If you think I'm joking, I was having my breakdown and couldn't think of a single person to call to distract me.  I woke up early to take my mother to work (My sister moved in without a car and she's using my mother's to get to work), and on the way there, my mother started the whole \"You need to get your room clean\" spiel. She's been hounding me for days now, and it's slowly getting picked up, but I know that she wants it spotless over a day.  \"Reminding me every day makes me not want to do it,\" I remind her, because she tells me every time my room gets messy (surprisingly super easy when you have depression!). She started with the \"You can't even keep your room clean like an adult so of course I have to remind you, it's a mess, it smells like death, it's terrible, it's disgusting, we're trying to get rid of fleas and bugs and your room is not helping.\" (I don't have fleas or bugs in my room, just a side note)  I'm so sick of being called disgusting and gross. I'm so sick of having to have the energy she does. I'm tired and it's even worse because I go to work at Starbucks, and on those days I absolutely cannot clean.  I managed to hold it together until she went in to work, and then started tearing up pretty bad on the drive back home. I got to my room, laid down, and started sobbing and generally having a breakdown. Got to the point where I considered just hurrying up and cleaning my room so I could self-harm afterwards as a reward. And this was at about 7:40 am. It's just so fucking frustrating and it hurts. It upsets me. I try my best but she doesn't believe I have depression so I should be as high functioning as her!  And before anyone comes in with that logical shit: I have tried to talk to her before. When I was 12-13, I told her that I was hurting myself and she called it stupid and threatened to stop sending me to school, stop letting me on the internet, stop letting me text a friend that helped me so much, stop letting me listen to music. Years later I told her I didn't stop after I told her, only for two weeks to avoid suspicion, then started again, to which she replied \"No you didn't. I watched.\" So her experience was more valuable than mine, the one actually doing the hurting. And I have \"too good of a life\" to be depressed, her words.  Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.

First I was worried about finding friends, then when I did I started doing stupid stuff. Every single person I met was either a drug user or dealer. The last people you\u2019d expect are the ones doing this type of stuff!Then I got anxiety over whether or not I\u2019d ever be in a relationship with someone after always seeing my friends with girlfriends. Sure I had my moments at parties but nothing long-term ever came out of it. I had bad anxiety during these days. Up to this point I was on anxiety/depression medication which did jack shit and only gave me bad side effects. I stopped that and then started doing more drugs.\nI would keep getting invited to different house parties and gatherings mainly because I got to knew people around me who had connections with others. The parties themselves were nice, quite literally fun as I live in an urban city and we\u2019d be in very nice high rises partying. But guess what? Everyone there was either a drug dealer passing out samples or people just getting fucked up.\nSo that\u2019s how I met my main dealer, and he\u2019s who I buy my shit from. It\u2019s so convenient to get anything I want it\u2019s ridiculous, and that\u2019s part of the problem. I fucked my self up by doing too many different things over the past few months. Believe it or not, my anxiety is not as bad but my depression has never been worse. I\u2019m talking about no desire for anything, no desire to hang out with people, emotionless, absolute nothing.

I'm on my second round of meds, first was a year of lexapro at 32, and now I've been on wellbutrin for about 6months. Right before that I did lexapro for 2 months but I actually hated it this time; felt like a right zombie. Anyway, I've been trying to do other things to help like work out, eat better, stop saying negative stuff...my husband has only ever experienced situational depression when he lost a job years back so he doesn't understand me (but we are working on that).Anyway, I have been going to therapy (unfortunately not as often as I would like as I pay for that out of pocket) and also am reading a self-help book. I try to exercise (my husband works in fitness so I can go for free, even) and change my eating habits. While I have improved in terms of how my lifestyle was in my 20s (burgers, alcohol, no working out ever), I still struggle so much with this changing mindset and behaviors etc. etc. I'll be good one week and the next I just slip back into old habits. I feel like...I read about it, and like, yeah, I'll try that, but a few days later I'm back in a hole. I've talked to some friends about how they deal with it. I just feel lost and like I will never be able to be that positive, motivated person. I also am considering upping my dosage; I'm currently at 150mgs.

My depression revolved around the idea that I literally had no control of where I was going in life. I was a sheltered kid, always staying at home never going to friends\u2019 houses. There were expectations from my family that I would go study a certain major, go down a certain career path, have a certain job. I wanted to do none of those things and I felt trapped by those expectations. \n\nSo there I was in my second year of college. I did have more freedom as had moved into dorms and away from home. But I was at the worst point of my life, not knowing what I was doing and why I was doing any of it. I was getting increasingly unhealthy and gaining tons of weight as I ate to relieve stress and get my mind away from depressed thoughts. I was planning to take my own life at the end of the school year, so nothing mattered anymore. I barely went to classes, and I ended failing 2/3 of them. The time came and I was just going to drive away somewhere and do it. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the turn. I couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nAfter that I realized that I didn\u2019t give a fuck about anything and I could turn that into a good thing. Do things I was afraid to do before. Now I didn\u2019t give a FUCK about anyone\u2019s expectations for me. I was going to live for myself and no one else. Freedom. I immediately switched majors to something I felt passionate about at the beginning of that summer, took summer classes to makeup for the lost time from my failed classes, and started going to the gym daily and dieting. I did it for ME, no one else. \n\nI had cared too much before about what people thought about me and my choices. My overweight appearance didn\u2019t make that any better. I graduated last summer and am healthy and fit, still doing the daily gym visits. \n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t dip every once in a while, back into a depressed state. It happens when I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do next and when I\u2019m stuck in a drifting state. I still can\u2019t really see or be excited about what the future holds for me. I\u2019m not looking forward to anything. But, it\u2019s better than having suicidal thoughts everyday. That was my life for 7 years, and I\u2019m finally digging myself out of the hole.

I've gotten much better at identifying activities that support my mental health and ensuring that they become a part of my life. I recently finished a long journey that took me from high school to the military to community college to nursing school and now I have my dream job at a big city Emergency Department. I grew up loving the feeling I got when I genuinely helped someone, and at my previous healthcare jobs I derived great personal satisfaction from using my skillset and personality to comfort people who were suffering. I work out regularly, I have a large group of supportive friends that make an effort to spend time with me, I see my family regularly and we're on very good terms. I have a variety of hobbies that I've invested a huge amount of time and money and focus into that used to bring me joy, like working on an old project car, making furniture, or sewing up a costume for an event/party. By all accounts, I am well loved.\u200bMy problem is that the satisfaction present in each of these things has melted away, and I'm left with nothing but the memory of pleasure whenever I have dinner with my family, when I think about working on my cars, when I go to work and help someone through a difficult time. The memory of pleasure I used to feel when doing these things superseded by the overwhelming sensation that I am stuck in a haze of despair and I can barely see my way out. The feeling is so intense that my physical vision actually blurs and becomes unfocused at its' peaks. The numbness that permeates my being is so potent that I can't even make myself cry or feel \"sad\" in the way I would before. I do my best to avoid seeming like a downer to my friends, because I treasure them and I don't want them to suffer or be pushed away by my melancholy, but despite this I can feel them slipping away because of my frequent avoidance of them. Never or slowly answering texts, making excuses not to hang out with people one on one (where I don't have a safety net and the conversation has to come from just two of us), and feeling scared and bumbling around people I've known and loved for years; these are all symptoms of my root problem, the nature of which remains a mystery to me. I've been in psych treatment for almost a decade, and my medication history list is a who's who of psychiatric medications, none of which have worked, and I feel progressively worse each year. Each year my feelings of utter isolation and melancholy grow stronger and the memories of happiness shrivel and die just a little more. What alternative is there left for me? Conventional wisdom would tell us that when we struggle with negative feelings, we should \"talk to our friends\" or \"talk to a professional\". What happens when we have exhausted these options? My friends are sick of hearing about my shit because I can't open up to them in a meaningful way, and my therapists have all tried to tell me how I felt instead of letting me talk about myself. What the fuck am I supposed to do? I don't particularly want to die, but I wake up and rue each day thinking that I have to get up out of bed and do things. I hate my job, I hate my hobbies, I don't like spending time with my friends, I don't like spending time with my cat even. I find myself irrationally doubting if my friends actually are my friends, concocting wild stories about how they are faking affection for various unsavory reasons. Doctors have tried at least two dozen types of pills on me and countless therapeutic techniques and now instead of being depressed and anxious, I'm depressed and anxious and asexual because of SSRI side effects, so even jerking off of all things doesn't feel good. That also pretty much seals the deal on my ability to attract the opposite gender, which was previously almost non-existent and at this point has kept me from dating for almost 8 years. I'm wasting away my youth, watching everyone around me live and love and find happiness and heartbreak and adventure and fulfillment while I binge netflix or scroll reddit for 10 hours a day to fill the time until I can finally lay in bed again and sleep, which is the highlight of my day because it's the only time I don't feel so empty and dead inside.\u200bBasically where I'm at is that I will keep going until my parents die, because I love them and I would never want them to have to deal with my death. That likely won't happen for at least another decade, so in the back of my mind I'm hoping that that goal will see me through til I can find something that helps, or it will have seen me give my absolute best shot before I throw in the towel.  I just don't know what else I can do at this point to relieve my depression; what else is there beyond the support of friends/family, regular exercise, a fulfulling career, regular therapy and medication etc? It feels like the medical establishment can't or won't help me. I want to try alternative therapies like ECT but I'm having a hard time finding a therapist that doesn't want to just keep throwing pills into my brainstew until something works and I'm sick of feeling like a lab rat. I'm also scared of ECT and of not getting ECT because if I don't get it, my depression is reaching the point where it's affecting my work and I don't want to kill someone by making a mistake because of \"the haze\", but I also don't want to lose my job because of memory problems brought on by ECT that might also make me kill someone (I'm referring to like medication errors here, not homicidal violence). Anyway, I appreciate anyone who took the time to read through this, I know it's a big wall of text but it felt good at the very least to type it out and tell \"someone\" even if that means a whole bunch of random strangers.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554707542.0, "author": "trowawaycat123", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/baqoml/is_it_really_a_sunday_night_if_you_dont_go_to_bed/", "title": "Is it really a Sunday night if you dont go to bed filled with sadness and dread?", "id": "baqoml", "body": "Just laying here with this ache in my heart and this feeling of dread.

I practically only eat dinner and play video games all day... other times I go in my backyard which is about 20+ acres and just hide away in some dark shaded spot and just cry. My parents don\u2019t know that I do this and they don\u2019t even notice I\u2019m gone for over an hour.

The only reason my parents got in trouble is because I\u2019ve been making up fake reasons for my absences. The real reason is I just don\u2019t care about life anymore. Even when I finish school it is just going to be another cycle of doing work most of my life, going home, and just not having meaning. I don\u2019t want to work for a career, a family or even a hobby. I play video games because it can help pass time because I don\u2019t have reason. if I put so much time and effort into something and I just die one day, wouldn\u2019t it just be for absolutely nothing. We ourselves as humans thrive to advance, but there is always an end. It will then be for nothing, and I\u2019m just scared and I actually want to kill myself but the only thing stopping me is what lies after our \u201clives\u201d.

Went through all the motions, the listlessness, the emptiness, the teetering on the edge to suicide. Just your plain ol' depression shindigs. I didn't think i'd ever get out of this and to tell it true I still don't.  So, after a long estrangement from my family, and failing at college at that, I opened up to my granpa who's my guardian and has been supportive all through my life and came clean. I opened up to him and though I could tell he couldn't really comprehend depression, he listened and that's what mattered. Plus the idea of flirting with suicide was one he understood.Just that little modicum of support, his listening, spurred me to seek help which I did. Went to a mental health clinic, got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, proscribed antidepressants( mirtapazine) and anxiety pills and scheduled for therapy. It's been two weeks and as I write this I'm headed to my first therapy session. I wouldn't say I'm very hopeful on it's impact but I'm glad for the step. Depression is a lifelong illness, heightened by the very traits of your personality that make you who you are. Thus, to counter it you have to dig deep into the depths of your personality and while not really changing who you are, modify these traits, suppreses the negatives for the postives. So it's a journey of a thousand steps but that first one is important. As is the second. Then the third. We'll soar, but first we must crawl. Taking joy in the small victories.There's been an improvement in my mood but that's not to mean I'm healed. Far far from it. I still have backaches, nightmares, lack of motivation, excitement etc but I'm improving, little by little, in decimal percentage points and I take joy in that. To all you depressed fellas out there, especially the ones in Africa where stigma on mental illness is off the roof, hang in there buddy, you are not alone, there's hope.

I have no one to talk to and (at least it feels like) the world is crumbling around me, and it's all my own doing and yet I can't bring myself to fix it. I feel like I'm a waste of life and am wasting my life.\u200bHere's the situation - other than the social isolation and loneliness and insomnia + constant tiredness and all that stuff of course. Basically, the larger issue is that I constantly shut down when confronted by important things that I must do because of a multitude of reasons, ranging from fear to embarrassment to... I don't know, just anxiety I guess.\u200bFrom answering phone calls from loved ones to going to college to getting a job.\u200bThe latter two are the most important issues I'm facing right now. Here's what's holding me back - fear and embarassment. You see, I did fucking terribly at the end of my high school career. I was breaking down for the first times in my life, I was letting down my teachers and parents, I was losing the few close friends I had via self-isolation, and I had no one. My transcript is ugly, I took a bunch of AP classes that my emotionally perturbed mind couldn't keep up with which is never good, and I never even took the SAT or ACT because I'm a pathetic, procrastinating moron.\u200bThese issues make my stomach hurt and make me want to die. I've always held academics to an extremely high regard, and doing so terribly in school... I don't know how to explain it. I don't know how to explain anything I feel very well but it *hurts*. It fucking hurts, it's painful, it makes me want to throw up. Add this to loss of friends while they continue on with their lives seemingly very happily... It makes heart die and my stomach curl up and become a painful pit/void.  It fucking hurts and it's scary and it's embarrassing. How do I get a job with these grades and lack of tests? Much less get into a good university like I've always dreamed? Where do I even start? Community college? What the fuck do I do? How do I live? How do I explain all this to my father and people to whom I've lied and told that I did well and got a scholarship when they inevitably find out? What the fuck do I do? And I'm scared even once I do go back to school that I'll just fail once again and this time it'll be something very hard to move past because it's college.\u200bI know life is full of hardships but this is everything to me and directly affects my life... And that's just that specific problem, not to mention my current social situation and physical health (I'm trying to start working out because I know that can help how I feel but I just haven't because... I don't know why... I guess I'm just a chronic procrastinator and have too much anxiety about things?). When my mom and I talked about my situation I could literally feel my stomach start dying and I didn't know how to effectively convey anything.\u200bI want to be alive, and yet I want not to be alive. Both simultaneously, and both very strongly.\u200bHow am I supposed to do all of this at once and with so little time left in life? I'm sure that sound fucking retarded as I'm 18 years old, but I know my windows of opportunity are closing on every aspect of my life - youth, friendship, accomplishments, school and good work that I want, friends and socializing, etc. - all things I've neglected all the way through my 4 years of my life.\u200bI SOUND LIKE A FUCKING RETARDED ENTITLED PIECE OF SHIT AND I FUCKING HATE MYSELF. BOO FUCKING HOO, RIGHT? I'M 18 THAT'S FUCKING NOTHING RIGHT? STOP CARING WHAT PEOPLE THINK, AND STOP CARING WHAT I THINK AS WELL... THAT'S WHAT'S HOLDING ME BACK, STUPID RUMINATION AND SELF-DOUBT AND PROCRASTINATION IN A TIME WHEN I SHOULD BE ACTING, NOT THINKING.\u200bAFTER RE-READING ALL THIS TRASH I'VE FUCKING TYPED I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH OF A FUCKING WHINY LOSER I AM, AND YET THIS SELF-AWARENESS DOESN'T HELP AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX MYSELF AND I FUCKING WANT TO DIE.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554703881.0, "author": "CommonDiscount", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/baq6j4/i_feel_like_my_friends_are_only_staying_with_me/", "title": "I feel like my friends are only staying with me out of pity", "id": "baq6j4", "body": "So I\u2019m 16 and have been really depressed and suicidal.

And, I really do.In reality, I choose to go through most of the week eating very healthy and exercising so I can make it to a span of several days where I am able to use drugs and feel better for a while. However, even when I'm on drugs I make sure to eat something to keep sickness away and drink plenty of water. Even my drug habits are healthy, for fucks's sake.I work out 4-5 times a week and try to eat a very clean diet. Sometimes I splurge on moderately unhealthy things (ice cream or red meat) but make sure to compensate for it in my next workout. In order to stave off physical dependency, I refuse myself any sort of drugs besides caffiene on days that I have work or school. have absolutely no idea why past \"it makes me feel good about myself.\" But, what the hell do I have to feel good about?I'm not a very good person. I do bad things without any real, deep remorse and only avoid doing certain bad things because of legal reasons (its not smart to do things that you'll easily get caught for) and because of whatever moral code I may have left. I neglect my mental wellbeing to the point of having daily suicidal thoughts. I have friends that I feel very distant from, and seem to be the only one that truly realizes that none of us really care about one another. Rather, we're like-minded folks that live in the same area and hang out. I only have two friends that I care about. One lives across the country and the other seems to not reciprocate my immense caring for him. I lost the love of my life to my terrible behavior (I did not cheat or abuse her, I simply pushed her away because I went through a very bad phase that caused her to fall out of love with me) and I will never be getting her back. We tried it again and realized it will never be the same. Now, I'm involved with a woman that seems to have the same amount of issues as me, except I question her motives and her mental illness impedes our budding relationship. In short, I'm lost. Playing music and working out bring me joy and make me feel good about myself, but those don't pay the bills. It's very frustrating to me that I can't find joy in my everyday, mundane tasks like working or going to school (which I'm almost done with, that does bring me happiness). I'm a weekend warrior at age 20 with no one in my life that actually, tangibly cares. I haven't cried in ages upon ages, but all I want is to curl up in a ball and sob while someone holds me. IK that's pussy shit to some, and I'd never say that outside the Internet, but its true.Suicide means that I disrespect God's gift of life that I've been given. But, I don't know how long I can keep this up until I become a full-blown junkie with literally nothing to live for. I'm hanging by a thread every day, and my inner motivation to stay above water and not die is all that keeps me going. I hate myself, I hate my surroundings, I hate my life, and I hate what I see in my future. I don't want this, and if substances are all that make me feel better, something has to change.

I'm 20, I could have been a lot of things I'm not right now, I've been with the most lovely girlfriends I could ever want, I lost them, they just get tired of me. A long ago I decided, I won't be falling in love again, I don't want it I don't need love. I'm now sitting on the bathroom 2AM. To begin, this is obviously not motivational, I'm just starting with nofap,\nMy first streak was 70 days, I don't count any streaks literally. its just the first diagnostic of my failure. After 20 years and more than 12 sports, 8 activities, I'm nothing, I leave everything. I started fapping at the age of 8, but now brushing my teeth I see myself and just want to keep staring at me forever, and never leave, because I'm not ready to the real world. It's not just porn, is everything, I'm in a infinite wheel of bad habits I cannot break, I need to wake up at 6am, it's 2am. I should have read 88 pages for tomorrow and I didn't ever bother to pick anything, just play games procrastinating. My eyes are tired, I shower everytime with cold shower so I can feel that freaking discomfort it feels good, I don't like it, I don't feel good with it, just feeling that cold water on my comfy warm body is so bad it's what it has to be.\nI took my first warm shower, there is nothing wrong with it, I just sit 18 hours literally just playing games, my eyes are on the floor, that warm shower did literally nothing, I don't feel relaxed or anything.\nAfter my 70 days streak I cannot maintain two weeks, but is not that important for me, I should just stop doing it. I just want to start again, on everything I did on my life, but I can't, obviously, I just want to be isolated from the world and fall in love with myself, it's just painful to not being able to understand what it's my goal in life, when I started uni last week, I just see every girl like a doll and that is totally wrong thats not me, and I'm supposed to study, not trying to fuck my friends. I've lost 1 girlfriend and 6 fem friends in less than 8 months, just being a fucking prick, being depressed, or just not understanding what a friend is. I'm tired of this. Now, my most big problem is procrastinating like a boss, I should've readed and studied for tomorrow as I said, I did fucking nothing, I should be sleeping so I can start my healthy day, I'm still awake, I should have shaved, shower, and care my face, and I'm a mess,my hair is a mess, my breath is a mess, dishes are about to take life and wash Themselves, my room is full of talcum powder on the floor. Video games are my drug, I'm not even playing games anymore I just make custom content and still being an obsessive, my phone pictures are full of crap I cannot even mantain it clean, I don't have any social media, I just deleted Twitter but I deleted Instagram when my girlfriend broke with me. I don't even have a profile pic only my wp. \nthe painful part is not when the person you love break with you, but knowing that she's right.\nI don't know where to start, how I should pace this, if atleast I could say I'm fucking shy or something but that's not even a thing, the moment I was in the uni I make the 70 people group just standing up on a blatant silence and just loudly speak to make a group, in front of more mature and less stupid people than me, but my mentality weren't right, I could have been thinking something like I should make a group so everyone help so I should stand up and not be shy, it was more like, I should stand up and make a group I don't have nothing to lose as I'm already a fucking idiot I cannot be more idiotic. I don't even care what they could think about me as they wouldn't remember next year. I'm alone, I know I have friends or \"friends\", it's just an anvil could fall on my head and they will know four month later, I wouldn't talk about my family as it's totally dissolved. I just remember arguing with my brother and I was crying and my brother told me while touching my chest pointing my earth \"your problem is here\" like something about passion, love. I still remember, and he is probably true, I'm not even crying or anything I don't know when was last time I cry, I don't want to love anyone as I cannot be enough so why the fuck bother, last be just friends. I eat healthy, go to the gym, my body is fit, so what, I'm dead inside, and my face reveal it. I'm studying Kinesiology as it's something I like, but passion?, I don't have any fucking passion, in fact I don't know why I should have a passion and what is based on, I like everything, it's not something I have control on, I though about fireman, as is not my passion, but atleast I'm doing something to help people, I don't even need to tell anyone I'm a fireman as I could just do my job and exist, but now I just want to be, but I can't, I cannot be happy with anyone when they try to be happy with me, I don't want them to fucking get tired of me so I don't give them the chance to, it's not that I cannot talk with girls or people, in fact a girl I sit next to my first day on the uni started talking with me, and socialize and she want to drink etc, but why? As her meting more of me she will just leave, so I just \"say oh yes we should make friends and hang out with them\" so I could disperse them without hurting anyone. I'm not even trying to write English with 100% correct grammar. The only moment I could ever feel emotions is when I see people on the streets fucking starving and I'm like a pussy just not being able to sincerely smile. I don't even like music anymore every little sound it hear is disgusting, silence is melody for my ears. I have a dog and I'm not walking with him as I used to do, so I'm probably giving up on him and let my doggo go with another owner that could make him happy, as he don't deserve suffering because his current owner is a fucking disgusting piece of shit, and yes, I will cry like a fucking baby when he is gone but I will know I made the most intelligent choice in my fucking life. So what I do?, cry?, nothing?, being productive?, live?, smile of nothingness?, study something I like or something that gets me money?, Isolate?, not falling in love again?, open an Instagram so literally nobody follows me but my uni partners and stalk successful people?, where do I start? Where do I end? What's my goal?: help people, smile for the first time after a years of not doing so.

I don't really know what love is, or what it feels like. I don't really even feel it towards friends and family, and towards partners it's closer to an infatuation or desire. So I can't really say I love myself, as I'm unsure if I've ever felt real love for anyone or anything.\n\nBut I do know what love would entail. So that's what I work towards.\n\nI start with forgiveness. Let go of that hatred and negativity. That can be accomplished through understanding and empathy. Understand what you've gone through, why you've done the things you have, and seek to accept those things. Know who you are. If you can, there is no space for hatred, because you are filled with compassion. Compassion for yourself and your struggle and suffering. \n\nIf a random homeless person came up to you asking for money, you may feel a bit put off and annoyed. But if you understood that person, knew who they were, where they came from, and what they were going through, you would be much more willing to help. The same principle applies to yourself. \n\nWork on appreciation. Things in your life you can appreciate. Doesn't have to mean you do right now, but you can. You can appreciate that you're alive. You may not feel that way, but life is opportunity and progress, it's chances to grow and become better. You can appreciate the skills and abilities you have. Even if you aren't where you want to be, you have things to you that are wonderful things. What are those things?\n\nEven if you don't believe them, don't let that wall of depression blind you. Look past it. Look beyond that negativity. If you had a friend in your exact situation, what would you say to support and compliment them? Say those things to yourself. Be positive and optimistic. Fake it if you have to. Just thinking good thoughts does wonders for your mental health, because it puts you in a mindset of productivity and strength. It pushes you forwards so you can actually accomplish them. \n\nThink about who you want to be. Who would you be proud of being? And work towards becoming that person. How would that person act? What would that person do? Set small, concrete goals that you can achieve and feel proud about. Be mindful of negative thoughts you have, and recognize that they only have as much power as you give them. Let them go.\n\nBe patient. In all things. Especially failure. If things don't go your way, don't beat yourself up. Learn from any mistakes and grow from them. Be kind to yourself, as you would to others, as you would like done to you. \n\nBe mindful. Love is cultivated. How can you grow to become someone you are able to love?\n\nYou got this.\n\nI wish you all the best."}, {"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "mangagnome1425", "created_utc": 1554704281.0, "body": "Thank you.

Love and companionship is something you should always want to look for, always be open for. It is necessary for a healthy, happy, human existence. It is definitely something you could have right now. There are plenty of depressed people in relationships. But I find that the vast majority of those people are depressed despite being in a relationship. If anything it makes them worse.\n\nThe quote I've heard is, No one will love you unless you love yourself. This isn't technically true, but a lack of self love does make relationships extremely difficult to manage. How can you give others love and support, if you cannot do so for yourself? How can you offer others kindness and patience, if you have no source of it within you? So forming a relationship when you are relatively comfortable, confident, and secure with yourself is definitely helpful. Because ultimately, you should not depend on someone else for love, acceptance, or meaning. Those are absolutely valuable things to receive from others, but should really come from yourself. If not, you'll always be dependent on others, always be searching and waiting. Relationships are a band-aid to loneliness, not a cure.\n\nNow, it's unreasonable to think you can make yourself into a perfect human being. It's also unreasonable to wait until you are a perfect being to be someone worthy or deserving of love. We are all deserving of love in our own way, but are sometimes unable to appreciate or maintain that feeling.\n\nAs such, I think you should focus on independence. Which is a factor of self-love. Work on improving yourself and your mental health, so that you are living a life you are proud of, regardless of whether or not you are with someone. Simultaneously, it makes you someone who is not desperate for a relationship, and someone who has more to offer once you are in a relationship.\n\nYou should also focus on communication, honesty, acceptance, and optimism. These are key to being in any healthy relationship, especially so if you suffer from mental health issues. It's possible that there will be things you will always struggle with, or need help or support with. That's okay. That's what relationships are for. But you don't want those things to drag down a relationship. So it's necessary that you can communicate your thoughts and emotions to others, that you can open yourself up honestly and be able to seek and accept help and support, and be optimistic in working towards fixing those things and moving forwards. If you do so, being depressed or insecure won't be a deal breaker, or a relationship breaker. They will be parts of your personality you are honest and open about, and working consistently on improving. And that is a really commendable trait.\n\n\"How much of this should I focus on fixing before I could ever try finding love?\" They aren't mutually exclusive. You can do both at the same time, and both benefit one another. Working on yourself will make relationships better, and being in a relationship can make you better.\n\n\"Is that something I should even look for anymore?\" Always be open to love and happy experiences. But don't be desperate for attention, or make someone else the source of your life's meaning/purpose. That's on you to create for yourself.\n\nDon't be afraid to get a girlfriend. Even now after I've said all this. Regardless of whether it goes well or poorly, a relationship makes you a stronger and wiser person, if you learn from it.\n\nYou can have a great relationship. But it shouldn't be all you want. And it shouldn't be the reason you want to get better. Love yourself for you, not so someone else will return the favor.\n\nThis is all my opinion. I'm no expert or professional, but I have some experience with these things.\n\nSo think about what I've said, and if it applies to you.\n\nTake your time.\n\nYou got this.\n\n&#x200B;"}], "created_utc": 1554701772.0, "author": "mangagnome1425", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bapwto/life_just_wants_me_to_kill_myself/", "title": "Life just wants me to kill myself", "id": "bapwto", "body": "No matter how much I try, life just wants to put me down.

Monday I had school, and that was great I got a good grade on my last two tests which shows that working on my mental health and keeping to my self is healthy. I keep learning that my husband can take care of me. I used to think that I had to do it all school cleaning cooking great meals and working. But that's just not realistic anymore. And I'm so lucky to have a partner that can catch me where I fall. \u200bTuesday was okay, I had work and I did my best to get three days of work done since I missed the following Thursday to study for my tests. I came home finished my hwk, enjoyed time with my husband and went to sleep. \u200bWednesday I went to school again and worked on my study guide early and finished it and converted it to a Quizlet so that I can study for the next test and hopefully next time I'll do better. \u200bThursday was where it started going downhill. I was on my a game all week getting stuff done and finding time to relax. I usually look forward to Thursdays so that I work in the ER and not the office but this wasn't the case for this Thursday. So on Thursday I had to go to work and do office work for an hour and try to finish as much as I can in 1 hour, then drive to my training for a new part of my job, and then get talked down to... because the lady that was teaching it was my co-worker who likes to act like she's better than me. Every time I said something she had to fix it or criticize it... Then she had technical issues and wanted me to help her, so I missed a lot of the training because I had to fix her computer which I wasn't able to do at the end of the day. Which meant that I had to go home and catch up. Then I had to miss my lunch break to make a ton of calls: one to my aunt to figure out stuff for a family event that's happening next weekend and plan stuff around it with my friends, then one to my bank to figure out how I can get a hold of my statement from last month to help my parents get their house, another to book an appointment to see my school counselor, and one more to book a dentist appointment. After I finished those calls I got a notice that someone charged over $100 to two of my debit cards... so then I had to call the banks again to cancel those unauthorized charges and cancel my cards, and then order new ones... now I have to go to the bank to get money out. Then after training ended I had to go to the bank to print out my bank statement like I was told I could only to be told that I would be charged $5 to have them print it -__-. Then after the training, and all that I had to go back to my office work and finish as much as I can again! Started the day and 8 and ended the day at 6. I was super stressed out and super cranky when I came home, vented to my husband only for him to tell me that my face looked oily and that I have a pimple on my shoulder... I was pissed... And so to make it up he was like okay how can I make you feel better, and I was like lets watch Shazam so I can get my mind off of things and he was like sure and I was like only if its financially feasible.... and then he opened his phone and told me about all the expenses that we made this month..... that doesn't really make me want to go out. I had to walk away from the situation after I explained how that wasn't cool. Then he came to apologize and ended up watching it anyways which did actually make me relax and feel better.. because it was a great movie. \u200bThen on Friday, I had the training again but this time no office work and no technical difficulties just my co-worker criticizing everything I said (: Then I ran into a co-worker that I needed something from only to be told that I can have it if I help him to make about 100 more of it next Thursday.. when I should be working in the ER... duck. But I got to go home early, then study and relax which was super cool. \u200bSaturday day time really made up for the last hectic days of the week. My husband and I were truly blissfully happy, just being lovy dovy and sweet to each other. I even ended up making Nasi Goreng which turned out amazing and had to write the recipe down to my additions of recipes I've come up with.  But then I made the mistake of calling my mother. This is what happens when I'm happy I think other people would be happy too. She basically ruined my weekend. \u200bLet me tell you about my mother. She has basically been emotionally abusive/ manipulative my whole life, probably the reason why I'm so resilient, and why other people saying stuff doesn't really get to me. But she still effects me. She had told me that I deserved to be physically abused after being physically abused by my ex, she had told me that she wished for a daughter but all she got was trash, she told me that no one will ever love me because deep down all she sees is ugly, she's told me that she hopes that one day my children mistreat me and disrespect me because that's what I deserve, she's called me a whore even though I didn't date a lot, shes called me the devil, she's told me many things that shouldn't come out of a mothers mouth. My mother. The woman that gave birth to me. The major reason for my major depressive disorder.  But she's always made sure that we looked nice without clothes, that we acted right in public, that we smiled, and that we never talked about our family's problems because the world should see us as perfect. She also does this amazing thing where she takes a situation and blows it up and rewrites it in her head so she looks like a victim so she never has to say sorry... and she never has said sorry for anything that she's done.\u200bSaturday continued: So I called my mother, I asked her how I was doing, told her that I loved her, sorry that I didn't call her this week but I was busy and that I'm doing really well in my classed and should be finishing this semester with all A's for the first time in my life. And all she took from that is I don't have time for her but I had time to see my friends on the previous Saturday. But I didn't give into it and I just moved on with the conversation and then she asked me why I wasn't staying all day for the event next weekend... and I said because mommy dear I have another appointment but I'll be with the family for more than 5 hours so that should be enough time to spend with my family and I'll make sure to give her lots of love in that time. So she says \"I guess your friends are your family now\" to which I replied \"Mommy I'm not like my cousin or brother where I'm single, live at home, and am able to listen to everything that you say\" to which she started crying and said \"You always say things to hurt my feelings\" and said okay and hung up on me. So...... being a good and respectful daughter I called her back and she didn't answer. That's where I left it. 12:00 am I get a text from her saying \"This is my last letter, don't come tomorrow. If you want to see your dad you can talk to him. I'm done with you but I love you a lot. Good luck with everything\" attached with a letter starting with \"A letter to my estranged daughter\" \u200bNow WHAT THE ACTUAL DUCK?! Like what did I do to deserve that?! \u200bSo I read it, cried my eyes out and then texted her back about how I'm going to therapy, taking antidepressants and almost killed my self 2x last year, which she didn't know about. But guess what? SHE DIDNT EVEN DUCKING REPLY! Like shouldn't that invoke some sort of motherly response? I guess not. \u200bCalled my brother about it cried some more and tried to go to sleep with a blocked nose. \u200bSunday: I woke up with that nice 'ol heavy dark cloud on me. Hello, depression. I didn't want to get out of bed, that was pretty obvious to my husband but he forced me to try. Eventually, I got up talked to my brother and I guess I provoked my mothers to start her reign of tyranny and she tore him and my dad up (who lives with her and bless his soul hasn't divorced her in the 30 years they've been together... Stockholm syndrome whats that right?) So then I called my dad who I wanted to see anyways to give him a knee brace since he's been c/o about his knee (he's 70), but he told me not to come and told me that if I treat my mom \"like that\" I have to treat him like that too and avoid him as well because they're a couple and its not fair to treat them differently... he's usually a very smart and logical man but I'm sure she rewrote the story to get him on her side. He's never done anything wrong or mentally painful to me he's always been a light. So then I called my aunt to tell her that I won't be coming to dinner and explained why to which she started crying, she didn't know that my mom was doing to us what she did to her. I guess my mom told her that it was her fault that their dad died and that she would never get anywhere in life amongst other horrible things, that you shouldn't tell your sister that's almost 10 years younger than you. I finally told my aunt about going to therapy and going on meds and she wasn't aware that it was that bad for me. She said she'd stay out of it though because she doesn't want my mom to get on her as well... and I understand, I wouldn't wish my mom's wrath on anyone. She started crying so much that she had to hand up because she was at the grocery store. \u200bSo I skipped dinner and went to lunch with my other aunt and cousins tried to get out my depressed mindset at least to a point where I can at least fake being a happy positive person, which I've always been great at, thanks to dear 'ol mom. I actually did enjoy time with them and probably needed to feel like I had a family after being told not to come to see my own parents... Still got the knee brace to my dad though by giving to my aunt to give to him since she'll see them later... stuff like that makes him know that I love him. He's a simple man and deserves the world and more for putting up with my mother for all these years. Spent time with my cousins took pictures, ate and came home.\u200bI tried to study when I got back, but whenever I tried my mind just goes to what's going on now and all the stuff she's done before. I'm trying to heal and become a better version of myself and I just can't deal with her right now. I feel like after 24 years of this I should be used to but she definitely finds new and exciting ways to hurt me deeply. So here I am writing this and feeling bad for my mind going to thoughts of hoping she exits my life peacefully & thinking that I can't ever be happy because she or life will find a way to ruin it... her more than likely. \u200bThats all... for now.

So for starters, I am currently enrolled in my local community college, I have never been to a therapist or been diagnosed with depression. I never call myself depressed, I know self-diagnosing is a big no no, but I have been struggling with what seems to be depressive symptoms since my sophomore/junior year of high school. I can't really remember much of what I felt since sophomore year, but I did hurt myself in various ways, and I remember being sad a LOT but not to the extent it is now. Even then, I never called myself depressed, but I did think about dying and honestly thought I wouldn't graduate, so when I did it felt amazing, but then the question of college came around. I knew I wanted to go o my local University, but I didn't even apply until late into the summer after I graduated.Now its even worse. My life feels like its falling apart, and I just don't have the energy to do anything. Even basic tasks like showering and making breakfast feels impossible. I think about dying a lot, and at one point I had a day to die set, and other times I've left my car running in the garage with the door shut. Nowadays, I feel less sad, and just more empty. It often gets to the point where it feels like I'm walking in slow motion, even songs I love sound so much slower and duller. I lost interest in absolutely everything, and its hard to even imagine myself one week from now let alone a year. I don't know who to talk to about this, I don't want to disappoint my family even more (they are all heavily religious, and last year my mother found out I was an atheist)and even if they weren't disappointed, I don't want medical bills to be a major burden to them, I already feel like a waste of money ans space. One of my friends who is diagnosed with depression, whenever I try to reach out, she talks about herself and her issues (I know that sounds extremely selfish but I have listened to her for 3 years and it feels like she has not listened to me once) my other friend I don't think would understand. I have made hints to her before but she almost ignores it and move on. Other than that I have no one. I don't have anyone to talk to, hell it got so bad I set up a meeting with the free therapist at my school and she cancelled on me, and at this point I feel like I'm ready to give up.I don't know who I am anymore, and I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I often look up \"reasons to live\" and before that did help, but now every reason appears trivial and unimportant. I'm not even certain why I'm making this post, I've never talked about my true feelings with anyone, I don't even post this on any of my social media, and anytime anyone asks how I'm doing I do the typical dismissals \"i'm fine, I'm just tired\" No one even knows that I regularly contemplate suicide. At the same time one of my worries is I'm just faking it, sometimes I'll have extreme highs, and I can barely remember what I was feeling before, as if I am someone else, probably why I've never talked to anyone.I'm sorry this is so long, it wasn't meant to be, I don't even know what the point of it is.

The situation here may vary but here\u2019s my two cents.Heartbreak is a master manipulator, don\u2019t give in to its temptations. DON\u2019T check their social media\u2019s to see if they\u2019re talking to other people. DON\u2019T keep texting them. STOP looking at old photos. Focus on getting yourself out of this fucking horrible rut. Right now it\u2019s about YOU and only you.The harsh truth is this. If somebody has broken your heart then they never fully valued your companionship in the first place. If someone truly loved you then they would never ever want to break your heart. They would always go out of their way to avoid making you feel like complete shit.Sometimes things fall apart for something even more beautiful to take its place. Don\u2019t sit and stew in the memories you had with that partner and the fear that someone else will take your place. You are fucking incredible and beautiful, there is someone else out there with all of their good qualities and more with less of the bad qualities.It\u2019s easier said than done of course but know that the less you flirt with the memories and the thought of them, the faster you will heal. Trust me. I am going through this exact situation right now and I\u2019m even falling guilty against my own advice here from time to time.You can do it. It may be over between you and them but it isn\u2019t over for you. It may even be for the best. Our minds like to fabricate this perfect future but the chances are slim unless you are both 100% committed and can prove it. Action in love is so much more powerful than colourful language. Remember that.If they give you hope for a second chance, take it with a pinch of salt. Don\u2019t completely fall for that possible ruse but don\u2019t completely disregard it either. Just focus on yourself and see what happens. Just keep in mind that if you do get back together, they will not change. Nobody is going to change their entire chemistry and personality just for you.I could go on forever but just remember to keep yourself busy, don\u2019t obsess over them, surround yourself with good people if you can.

FRIDAY, I'm asked to go out driving with a friend of mine, the person I like (let's call her A), and another one of their friends. I say \"sure, why not\" that's probably my biggest regret out of this entire thing because what I didn't know is that the friend that they wanted to bring was this dude who has been ostracizing me from day 1 at my new school (let's call him dick). So we're driving around listening to music and going to some hotspots of our town and we decide to kick it at my place. Everything seems to be going well, I'm showing them some top quality memes, their all laughing and having fun but I am sitting in sorrow trying not to have a mental breakdown or even show emotion. Why? Because whenever I turn to look at the rest of the group I see dick flirting (not the passive type of flirting I mean full on flirting) with A, In MY room. So after about 4 hours of stoically enduring this, they all leave, except for the friend who was spending the weekend at my place. Him and I watched videos until he went to sleep and I silently cried myself to sleep. SATURDAY, I wake up to my friend watching videos so I decide to join him, still feeling like shit from last night. Until he asks me if I want to go out driving again, I say yes because dick wouldn't be there. This was probably the highlight of my weekend, just my friend, A and I driving around off-roading a little and would've been a great time if I hadn't had the vision of A and dick hitting it off stuck in my head making me miserable. This goes on until everyone had to go home. SUNDAY (today as of writing this), AGAIN I'm invited out but to watch a movie this time. I say yes because I didn't really have a choice. We get to the movie theater, buy our drinks and popcorn, then we head to our seats. Of course dick and A sit next to each other and I get stuck next to them \"great, I get to watch this happen again\" I think to myself. I called it, they were flirting just like the day before. It was a horror movie as well so dick and A were doing the whole couple at a horror movie clich\u00e9.

If this gets deleted then I'll at least have finally said my story and felt like I am not holding it inside of me. So here is what has led to me making this post.When I was in 6th grade my brother, a year older than I, started experimenting with drugs. It was weird because I knew what was going on sort of but didn't know what to make of it. I remember sitting in a bush ina public park while they smoked weed and I asked what we would do if someone walked by and my brother's friend pulled out a knife and said he would stab them. Seems excessive for a little bit of weed. By 7th grade my brother has begun taking pills frequently and I went to middle school and lost all of my friends. My brother was known for being wild and I felt like I lived in his shadow. I was known to all as his brother and not as OddSyllabub. I went through middle school and made one good friend, who I started smoking with a lot. This was really just to cope with the fact that I had nothing else to do and only having one friend in the world was a lot easier when I was high. That year I decided to force myself out of my comfort zone and separate from my cohort and go to a different high school than everyone I know. I had such big problems talking to other people that I knew I had to force myself to learn how to make friends. That summer my dad told me I was never allowed to see my friend again and I never really did. That summer my brother also tried to get me to take a bunch of cough medicine with him because it \"makes you feel like youre on ecstacy\". I wouldn't do it with him and instead he took it all and led me to one of the scariest days of babysitting I have ever had and the worst screaming fest with my parents I had ever witnessed in my life. I should have said earlier but I share my room with my brother. He started to seem depressed and often I would wake up in the middle of the night to him stumbling around our room in the middle of the night. After a few times this happened I stayed up in bed and quietly watched him sneak out of bed and go to the garage to drink all of my parents beer before stumbling back to bed a while later. After my parents caught on to this they started to hide all of the alcohol in the house so he moved on to trying weird shit like eating large spoonfuls of nutmeg or whatever weird shit assholes on the internet would jokingly suggest doing to get high. At the end of the summer I went to one of my teammate's birthday party, which was extra important because I had known him for a while and after this he was going to move across the country. We all had a pretty bitchin day but at the end of the day I got a call from my dad saying that I wasn't allowed to sleep over and that he would be there soon to pick me up. When I got in the car my brother was in the backseat looking very pale and quiet. A few minutes into the ride he screamed and yelled about spiders falling from the ceiling and started slapping the seats around him. Then my dad told me that earlier in the day he had been caught by some mall cops after smoking K2 in a bathroom, because he started hallucinating wildy and was screaming in the bathroom and hitting the walls. So my dad had to pick him up earlier and talk to the police about it I guess, and he spent the whole day watching my brother hallucinate at home before coming to get me. Days later I was thinking about this and I felt like something else was going on, so I found my brother's diary and found the day this all happened. Apparently the K2 only lasted about 15 minutes, and that after arriving home he took about 30 benadryl in an attempt to kill himself but instead had intense hallucinations lasting all day long. Now at night sometimes he would sneak around in our room and would go to hiding places and pull out pills that I could hear him swallowing and I would stay up for hours trying to see if he was going to die or if he was just trying to get high. I couldn't make a big deal and wake everyone up because then he would get in more trouble and his emotional problems would only get worse. So as school started and I tried to fit in with a whole new school, I spent my nights laying awake watching my brother, falling asleep only after hours of watching his chest rise and fall in the dark to make sure he hadn't stopped breathing. After a few weeks I couldn't take the lack of sleep anymore and I started to trust that he wasn't going to kill himself. At this point I felt like I wasn't doing anything with myself. I hadn't made new friends. All of the people at my old school seemed to have forgotten me. I decided that I didn't want to sit around at night hoping someone would interact with me online or something because it just wasn't going to happen and I sure as hell wasn't seeing anyone in person. So as soon as I got home from school I would take like 8 servings of melatonin or benadryl so that by like 7pm I would pass out and I wouldn't wake up at all in the night. In school I felt overwhelmed by all the new people and I just couldn't find a way to enjoy myself no matter what so I started to bring alcohol to school and just get absolutely plastered during class because I didn't want to have the presence of mind to think about what was happening around me. All the while the situation with my brother had gotten a lot worse. He was no longer allowed to be left home alone because he would drink something or take some pills or just in general fuck his life up. He had this girlfriend who I thought had been helping him. His diary seemed a little less depressed and he seemed to cut himself less often. Then one day he broke up with her for whatever reason and she told him that she was going to get her friends to beat him up and she verbally abused him constantly. He was taking cough medicine by the bottle at a time and would just lock himself away in his room to do whatever he did. This whole time my parents would find his drugs or see that he is high and chew him out but I don't think they had any idea how to deal with this. One particularly bad day for him my dad found his bottle of cough syrup and was yelling at him and honestly I am not really sure what happened because I sat in the tv room and just listened and felt nothing because I had effectively lost the ability to feel emotion because of all the sleeping medicines I took which gave me the most intense brain fog imagineable. I remember hearing them screaming at each other and my dad saying that he had to leave and them grabbing his mattress and getting ready to go. Then my mom and sister got home and my mom sat us down and tried to explain to us that they had to move my brother to a new place where he didn't have anything he could hurt himself with and my dad could keep watch over him, while she sobbed and my sister screamed about being afraid he was gonna kill himself. My guess is that my dad also discovered him part way into another suicide attempt after finding his cough syrup. This was a major focal point and my brother got put on a lot of meds for anxiety and depression and he stopped seeming so sad but he also seemed to just be an empty shell of a person. Towards the end of 9th grade things seemed a little better but in no ways good. I remember in the car I told my dad a story about someone I knew in middle school who had a brother who acted like mine, who went up to north carolina for a \"family vacation\" where his parents dropped him off at a military school and left him there for years. At the time my dad looked at my mom weird and asked me if the school helped and if the kid was good now and I was like hell I don't know it was supposed to be funny what does it matter. About two weeks later I found out why they were so weird about it. In the middle of the night my mom woke me up and moved me to her bed and I was so deeply asleep that I mindlessly moved and fell back asleep. I woke up at like 10 on a school day and I walked out to see both of my parents in the kitchen and they looked at each other and said asked if I remembered my mom moving me. I only remembered after they said this so I said yes and they asked if I remembered anything else and I said no. So they explained to me that for the last few months they had been talking to a boarding school that was also kind of a rehab place. That night two workers came in at my parents request, and they all woke him up together and talked to him and they agreed he needed to make a change and he went willingly, and as we spoke they were on a plane across the country. My parents told me to just tell people that my brother finally got accepted to go to a good boarding school he wanted to go to. Fast forward to the summer after 9th grade and I felt a lot better. I actually got my first girlfriend that summer and i felt really good for the first 3 months we dated. Then when we argued the first time she was really mean about it and I, trying to be kind when she was upset, just apologized and took it. This is how a lot of our relationship went. For about 8 more months I'd go about life, with the occasional minor fuck up, when she would scream at me through the phone and make me cry berating me and I would just take it, or she would drive to my house and yell at me there. She made me cut off all of the female friends I made at school. One day I was hanging out with a large group of guys and one girl she didn't like was present, and I finally got mad at her for being an asshole, so she came to talk about it. I got in the car and she actually kidnapped me and wouldn't stop no matter what I said, so I ended up having to yank her emergency break driving at 40 mph to make her stop and then I had to bail out. Somehow after a long argument the next day we were still dating. weeks later we decided to take a break for a month. We finished our break and things seemed a lot better but she acted weird around me all the time. First day of my 11th grade I found out she had been having sex with one of the best new friends I had for months. I tried to fight him and he locked himself in a car, later that night she came to meet me to talk about it and she basically just sat there threatening to kill herself for hours late into the night while I had to muster up the emotional energy to patiently convince her not to late into the night. At school she still clung to me and the idea that I loved her because I was nice enough to try to prevent her from killing herself. Weeks later she was sent to a mental facility of sorts and I never saw her again. I think my experience with this girl was the first thing that happened to me that actually changed my personality. Even after I stopped feeling sad about it I never felt relaxed or secure in any way and that persists today. My brother came home and he finally seemed to be better than before. He seemed like he had his personality back and he wasn't trying to do drugs anymore and you could actually see that there was a human behind his eyes again. It was all great until one night when he relapsed and did a bunch of xanax and ran away from my dad while he was stopped at a red light. I only heard about this through the phone and my mom took my sister and I to the area to try to hunt my brother down late at night. After about a half hour I saw him laying on a sidewalk and I jumped out of the car to get him and I convinced him to get back in the car and to come home with us. Nobody in my family knew what to do so we got home and just didn't really say anything about it. Some weeks later when we had stopped thinking about it my dad came home one night in a rage with my brother because he was high out of his mind on xanax again. I sat at the kitchen table and tried to do my homework while my brother stalked around the house with a knife yelling about killing everyone he knows and killing himself. After a while he passed out and I went to school the next day like nothing happened. Towards the end of junior year the drug use had again become such a problem that we couldn't deal with it. Lucky as we were, the problem dealt with itself. One night after coming home high and threatening to beat my mother up my dad pushed him and he immediately called the police. So the police came and my dad told them exactly what happened and they took my dad to jail and we tried to get him to stay. After they left we told my brother he had to leave and the cops offered to drive him somewhere else in town if he wanted and he took them up on their offer and we didn't see him for weeks. My dad was let out of jail the next day and on sobering up my brother dropped the charges, although we didn't see him for a long time. Over the summer my brother got arrested, bailed out, put on probation, and broke his probation and was sent to prison all within a few months. After getting out of prison a few months later he went to live a few hours away while the rest of my family went on with life. During this time I had been dating a new girl who was a lot better to me. I had applied to a lot of colleges and was very excited to go to the same school as many of my best friends. I had done really well in school despite all the distractions life offered and I was very confident I would get in and the day admissions came out all my friends sent pictures of their acceptances in a group chat and I was excited to get home and look. Maybe I would even get into the honors college. I then found out I didn't get in at all. None of my friends seemed to care too much. they had a really good time talking about how much fun it would be and about all the stuff they'd be doing at school. I applied really late to as many far away schools as I could because I wanted to go to school across the country and never talk to anyone again. I got denied by every school I applied to. I went back to the school I wanted in the first place and appealed and wrote an essay about dealing with the trauma of my childhood with my brother while being in school and I got in. But not before I became bitter with all of my best friends and my outlook on life had changed to view everyone and everything negatively. I was so upset all the time about it and I knew my parents felt horrible for me. The day my acceptance came in the mail I think I had prom or something else important that was causing my rampant anxiety to run wild. I got home from wherever in a hurry to get ready and my whole family was in the front yard and I could see the excitement on my parents faces and I didn't know why. I also wondered why everyone was standing in the front yard for no apparent reason. My dad asked me to grab the mail and i did and saw the letter and i just blankly stared at it for a few seconds before speed walking inside to get ready. They asked me what it was and all I said was that I got in and I have to figure some things out and didn't mention it again. In hindsight this event makes me want to cry so hard for my parents. I had pretty evidently been very depressed for a really long time and they knew that the college thing was a massive part of it. My dad mustve seen the mail and they all decided to put the mail back inside the box knowing I would get home soon, they all waited in the front yard so they could watch me open the mail and get excited and finally be happy again. I feel so horrible that they were excited for me and when I saw it I was in such a horrible state of mind that I didn't give a single shit that I had gotten what I worked for and solved my problem. Anyways I only realized this long after and i have no place to apologize now. months later I am at the school I wanted with all of my friends just like how I wanted. My girlfriend was going to another college a few hours later and we were going to try to make the long distance thing work. About a week and a half in I had my first emotional breakdown after spending an entire day inside doing literally nothing and not interacting with a single other person. This ended up happening a lot. I rushed and tried joining a frat and I pledged for 5 weeks but that far in, I hadn't made new friends with any of the other guys and I was the only odd ball out so I dropped and haven't really spoken to any of them since. After I dropped I thought I could still go out and enjoy college a lot and make friends. fast forward to second semester and I haven't made a single new friend. I literally have not met a female in months. My girlfriend joined a sorority and suddenly has no time for me. It makes me really jealous to see how they are all so nice to her but when I tried to join a fraternity I just got shit on constantly. She goes out to bars and clubs more than once weekly and she has so far lied to me twice about hanging out with other guys. At this point I don't know what our relationship is. It as been nearly two and a half years and she lies to me about guys going to some sorority events and about what she is doing with her friends. I have not gone out in months. I pretty much just sit in my room and either study, try to relax, or talk to her while she goes out and does things and I sit in my room and feel worthless. At this point I don't know if she has cheated on me or if that is just the paranoia of the fact that the only other girl I had loved cheated on me too. My life lately has just been sitting in class and sitting at home and I have never felt like I am so meaningless. I am only afraid of the future. My classes are going to get harder, my girlfriend will either become more consumed with sorority life and her friends, or we will break up and it won't matter what she does but I will be alone nonetheless. Then once I either graduate or drop out I will (hopefully) get a job, where I will have even fewer opportunities to meet people and other women and my life will become even more monotonous as I start a cycle of 9-5 workdays that will last until I am 60. I have had this feeling of hopelessness that I have had many times before, but never has it lasted for so long. I feel like I have never truly been happy during my life and it very surely seems like my potential to feel happy is only going to shrink. I truly don't know what to do with myself. I feel so horrible for my parents. Even if I can stand having a meaningless life I can't stand the thought of my poor parents thinking it is somehow their fault that I have been depressed for just about my entire adult life.I hope I did a decent job giving this some sort of flow. Obviously it is long but it missed a lot of semi important things that I kind of wish I included. Im torn between posting this and not posting it because I don't want to whine and act like im the only one who has run into problems. But I know thats the ideology that makes many people feel worse about themselves so I guess I am making myself post it. Just writing this all out has been rather cathartic. I hope someone else out there gets enough enjoyment reading other peoples life stories to go through this whole thing. \u200b", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "Chosen_loved", "created_utc": 1554700163.0, "body": "I\u2019m so sorry for everything you\u2019ve gone through.

More importantly, find yourself a hobby to be passionate about. It gets much easier to find friends when you share similar interests or present yourself as someone interesting. It may seem difficult to motivate yourself to do that, but just know that it gets easier. It might get harder first, but it always gets easier eventually.

I only recently got a little bit of help this past month at 28. My grandpa died at the end of January after about a decade of flip flopping between cancer and no cancer. It still hurt even though we knew it might come and it rocked my family to the core. My dad lost his mom a decade ago, and now his dad. Only he and my younger brother are left with the Weaver name (my biological dad died before I was born so its step dad and step brother though he and mom never got married. Me and my bro are blood related tho). My brother took it hard as he and grandpa (my stepdad's dad) had been best buds over the last few years of treatment. He comes to me finally and tells me hes had a gun in his mouth 5 times these past months. I find out how he has been struggling with depression since his teens as well (hes 25). Having just gone to the doctor and finally getting medical help to take the edge off with meds I talk him into going as well and he does. It helps. We talk a lot more and have helped each other through things. Hes only been on it for a couple weeks but its helped him and we were both finally becoming ok this past week. Monday my father died. Heart attack, instant death, no warning and no health conditions..... just gone..... mom found him 4 hours later. She called me before she called the ambulance, I drove an hour and a half from my home to go grab my brother from work and tell him we need to go see dad because something happened. I was still under the impression there was a chance he'd be ok, I didnt know he had passed yet. Mom calls me 5 minutes from picking up my brother and finally tells me dad had been gone the WHOLE TIME but she needed me to get to my brother safely so she couldn't tell me just yet. She knows how bad it's been for my brother the past few weeks as he had talked to our parents about getting help. Have to break the news to my brother who has only been on meds for 2 weeks after months of close calls to suicide. My brother BREAKS and goes into toddler mode, screaming that dad can't be gone. We book it home and lose our shit together. I've had close calls to suicide but I could never do it because I couldnt do that to my brother. He has always been so fragile and he became even more so that day. My mom is going insane, as this is the second \"husband\" she has lost in a lifetime and she almost lost her son recently on top of already losing the grandpa that lived next door 2 months prior. My whole family has been destroyed in a matter of 2 months. I've been drinking tons of water but I'm still dehydrated with cracked lips and a light scab all over my face from crying and wiping tears. I do6nt know how we are going to handle the farm my mom and brother live on anymore. We are going through estate paperwork from my grandpa's girlfriend of 5 years who died 2 months before he did, and bow grandpa's estate, and bow my dad's, of which everything trickles to my brother and NOTHING is in my mom's name because they weren't married. Our state doesn't recognize common law marriages (at least 10 years together). My brother is cracking under it all and I'm going to be gone right after him if he goes. He is the only reason I have lived this long. I stayed alive specifically for him and its destroying me to watch him disintegrate. I dont know what to do and it hurts so much. I put up an emotional wall the day after and felt so guilty that I couldn't cry that day, but I couldnt grieve because I needed to be strong for my brother. Watching him scream and cry that daddy cant be gone while he held onto my father's body was torture. I've been having nightmares what little I've been able to sleep over the sounds that came from my brother this past week. It's going to haunt me for the rest of my life.I'm stone walled again. The meds are trying their hardest but this hurt is DEEP. My dad was gone instantly, at a healthy 51. He just had his birthday March 5th. I'm trying not to fall deep into the rabbit hole again, but I'll never have a father-daughter dance if I have a wedding. My future kids will never know their grandfather. My dad stepped in 3 months after I was born and took me and my mom as his own. He has been my DAD from the begining. I was his first kid, even though we have different last names he always talked about me and was so proud of me apparently.  I was the first person to go to college in my whole family on any side and he was so proud because he only ever made it to 10th grade. I miss my dad. I miss him so much and I'm terrified I'm about to lose my brother, and not that it's a priority but I'll also lose my family home and land if he goes, as he is the only one able to inherit anything. If he goes then the state gets all of our property. No home, no cars, no brother, dad, or grandpa.This is the worst year so far. It has to get better right? I said that same thing after grandpa, then again after my brother told me about how close to death he got, and now I'm asking myself again and I dont know if it ever will. It's one thing right after the other. I finally had help with my depression and was starting to get better and now I dont think I'll be able to come back if my brother cant handle it...

Yes, he was vaccinated. For three days I stayed at the hospital with my parents, I didn't eat  or sleep much. Looking at him broke my heart so much. He was only three and innocent. A light in the dark for me. Before he was born, when my mother lived with my biological father, life was honestly hell. My father was an abusive, irresponsible, and with no respect. He did things that I can never forget and for the longest part of my childhood his actions scarred me. He would beat my mother with no regards about the effects on his children. For a while I was scared of grown men, being alone with an older cousin or uncle would keep me on edge. Even now, although I know that not everyone is the same, Im still very uncomfortable.  Because of this, I struggled to make friends and was constantly isolated. I was always stressed as a small child.I don't want to go much into detail about him but know that what he did ruined me and my childhood. After we finally got away from him, my mom met my step dad. I love my step father, he's more of a father and a man my bio dad ever was. Together they had my baby brother. I remember the exact day my baby brother was born. I was so excited to have another with us, he represented a new start in life. I was taken to the hospital a few hours after he was born and it hurts me so much to think that; I was there the same day, at the hospital, when he was born and I found myself at the end. I stayed at the hospital for three days hoping for a miracle but it never came. I loved him so much. I cried for days and days I wanted to die with him. I don't know what to do nowMy brother died, I spent so much time with him. In a way, I felt like his second mother, not that my mom didn't care for him, we were so close I miss him so much I wish I could see him again, to play with him, eat, sleep and just do everything we used to do. I feel so empty, I lost all motivation.Im so lonely, I have no friendsOne moment I feel fine and the next I want to end it all right there and then. I want to move on, I know I can't bring my brother back but I want to see him again one day.

I guess I'll start from the beginning to explain myself more clearly. I am sorry if its a little long. I am 29 years old now. I first seeked help for depression about 5 years ago. I feel like I have always been a little depressed since high school but I could always surpress it with being organised and I was motivated to exercise. But around 5 years ago I couldn't take it anymore. I had withdrawn myself from everything and just stayed in my room all day riddled with anxiety.I was a student at the time and my grades dropped that year and the next semester I pulled out to recover a bit. I went on antidepressants (reluctantly) for the first time ever. I worked part time at a restaurant and it was always easy to pick up extra hours so I worked full time there instead. After I returned to uni my grades got a little better and I had motivation to do better. But if you look at my academic transcript I was at university for about 6 years where my triple major should've only taken 4 years. I am explaining this now because it's been two years since graduating and I haven't heard back from any jobs I apply and I don't have the confidence/motivation to find work anymore. During my time at university I met a girl and we fell in love and I opened up to her about my depression. I hardly open up to anyone I always bottle things in. I feel people see mental health as a weakness so I try to not tell people I have it. I am still like this but some people can sense something isn't right with me and ask if I'm OK. I still say I'm OK and try change subject. I also isolate myself from everyone to avoid this and my biggest problem is social anxiety. Me and and my gf broke up last month and its all my fault. We broke once before already but made progress. I am fucking gutted but its gone too far to recover from it. Her parents came overseas to live with us for 6 months and we didn't get along and it built up alot of tension in our relationship. I only lasted 4 months before going home to live with my parents to try improve my mental health. But unfortunately the day I left we broke up a few hours later because she couldn't take it anymore. So now I am 29 years old, living at my parents which I hate. Jobless. Depressed. Running out of money so I have no where to go. I feel so fucking stuck. When I look for jobs I feel overwhelmed and anxious before even applying for it. I already feel I am worthless and they will ask why I took so long to graduate and why my grades are so bad. I don't know what else to write... Hopefully someone can give me some advice. Thanks for reading.

I come from a family with no educational background and despite being the only one in my household to complete high school and have some college i still feel like a loser. The only reason i never got to finish college was due to financial reasons, but im planning on going back when i have enough money. I was never even able to maintain any jobs for long and my current job is actually the longest one ive held and im not planning on quitting so i guess its something. Im always relying on rides just to get to work or anywhere in general and i hate it with a burning passion. Im planning on saving up some money and taking driving lessons and hopefully i wont be too anxious behind the wheel. I hate my job like every other person, but i cant afford to quit because im almost 23 and saying i dont have experience everywhere i go is one of the most embarrassing things next to not knowing how to drive. Sometimes i wake up and think to myself wow, its the same repetitive agonizing cycle everyday and i want to put an end to it, but i have a family i need to keep going for.

Impossible. No one can find the time. Everyone suddenly forgets they had made plans earlier when it comes time to hang out. It is always \"can't today, but how about tomorrow?\" And come next day you get the same response. No one wants to be around me, before and after the break up.

I just want to say I'm currently suffering from severe depression and it's slowly getting better, but I want to get this off my chest. Romance has never been great for me. I crush on a girl, sometimes more than I should, and it always comes back to bite me in the ass hard. Sometimes you just get fasley led on and you have to deal with it. Anyway, I'm just casually browsing tinder looking for a hookup, after some failed attempts at romance which may have helped me spiral into this mess... and in the process I meet an amazing girl. She does theatre and dance, has similar taste in music amd whatnot. She was my type. So we chat, and hit it off well, checking for times we can meet up on a date. We were an hour apart which isn't a big deal, we would just have to finesse schedules as I had class and she was in tbe middle of rehearsals. Finally we find a weekend in the near fututre, things are looking great! She's literally perfect, and maybe I still feel that way. We talked consistently for a month and it seems like it could all work out. Then I'm not sure what happened, what I did if I did anything at all. She blocked me on all social media, my number, everything. I have no way of contacting her, and to this day I've never said a word to her since. And it was so abrupt, almost mid conversation? My mind cannot begin to comprehend what happened. I'm just thankful it happened to me when I'm doing better, because it really put a dent in me. It feels silly to crush on a girl I've never had the pleasure of meeting in person, but when things seemed good and it just ends like that, it really makes you feel like shit. And I still feel like shit. At this point I just want to give up on relationships, I just don't know what to do. I want something meaningful that will help me. And I guess I've just never fallen for the right girl yet. Although it hurt, it still didn't send me back down near to where I was a few months ago. Depression is still kicking my ass but all I can do is keep going. Thank you to anyone who read thjs clunky post, it's silly but it means alot.

Experiencing the same shit over and over again and hoping for a different result every time, but it NEVER comes. It NEVER fucking comes. I have come close. REALLY close. BUT IT ALWAYS eludes you. ALWAYS. EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKIN. TIME. Last week. Last month. Last year. Last 5 years. Last 10 years. SAME problem. No matter what I do. SAME fucking shit. IT NEVER FUCKING CHANGES. IT NEVER GETS BETTER. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. IM FUCKING TIRED OF THIS SHIT. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK, AROUND THE BOOK, AND FLOATING ABOVE THE BOOK, AND UNDER THE BOOK. FOR FUCKS SAKE JUST ONCE WHY CAN'T I BE HAPPY LIKE ALL THE OTHER FUCKING MONKEY DUMB PEOPLE BEING HAPPY. WHY ME. WHY DOES IT NEVER CHANGE. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. It's like the SAME fucking nightmare OVER and OVER again. No matter WHAT you fucking do it rears its ugly head in your life again. Just GO. just STOP. JUST CHANGE. FOR FUCKING ONCE. EVERY fucking time I have hope and it APPEARS that I will FINALLY get what I wanted, I fall flat on my face again. Then while down I see just how EASILY and EFFORTLESSLY others get it. IT JUST KILLS YOUR WHOLE FUCKING MOTIVATION. YOU FEEL LIKE A CLOWN FOR TRYING AGAIN. It is like playing the fucking lottery and expecting to win the jackpot.

It hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth sailing the entire time either, but I\u2019ve loved being with him. He was my first boyfriend and first love. We started dating not long after he moved to the city I live in, so I was in a way his only social outlet. Because of this, he struggled a lot with boredom and turned to drinking (I suspect drugs also). I know he\u2019s been struggling with depression and anxiety mentally for a long time. His situation then was exacerbated by his work situation. He ended up quitting his job and moving back to his parents 9 hours away. \nBefore the move, there was no inclination or sign that I picked up that he didn\u2019t want to continue this relationship. We had talked previously about spending our lives and future together, and I thought this was a mutual want for us. I\u2019m in med school for 3 more years, so unfortunately me moving with him was never an option. The week of his move, he decided he didn\u2019t want to try long distance anymore and broke it off. A few days after getting back home, he seemed to change his mind and wanted to try. So we talked for a few days, but I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced he truly wanted to. Turns out my fear was right. Last night he called me (very drunk) and said he didn\u2019t want to try anymore. He said he is miserable living everyday. He kept reiterating that \u201cI deserve better\u201d and \u201cstill have other options\u201d. I feel he\u2019s always been self conscious that he\u2019s \u201cnot good enough for me\u201d because of his depression. I tried to tell him that\u2019s not what I wanted, and I was there to support him. He got upset then and said I just needed to leave him alone and stop doing this to myself because \u201cI\u2019m too good for his problems\u201d..  He\u2019s always seems to think also that I\u2019ll meet some doctor while at school and forget about him or cheat. I don\u2019t know how to make it known that\u2019s not in the realm of possibility in my mind. I love him. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t, but I do. I don\u2019t know what to do. \nI\u2019m so scared because I want to focus entirely on him, but I can\u2019t. I have to be a little selfish too, for my sake, and focus on school. I also have some family issues going on that need my attention. I don\u2019t know I can give him all the attention he needs. So I feel like I\u2019m in a huge predicament..\nI feel like if I give up, I\u2019m failing him in a way. But I also want to respect his need to take care of himself and give him space. At this point, I\u2019m just worried about his well being and afraid he might attempt his life. I called his parents last night to tell them he was not ok.

I grew up in a super conservative religious environment (forced into it by my parents), as an only child, and with emotionally abusive parents who were only together because divorce isn't allowed in the church (side note: apparently a child would help save the marriage, and also my grandma wanted a grandchild). I was isolated from the world outside the church, told not to make close friends at school, rarely taken to visit family because they weren't in the church, not allowed to date, etc. I ended up getting married at 19 in an attempt to find a semblance of happiness, and finally got up the courage (after many therapy sessions) to get divorced and leave the church and my parents altogether at 21. Since then I've become financially independent, got a PhD at 24, started a career, all the stuff that's good on paper. But I'd trade it all for close friends and family, for people to lean on. I have this terrible neck/shoulder/head pain which is supposedly from anxiety, and the way I think of it is that I can only lean on myself so of course my muscles are ridiculously tense. I didn't ask to be born into that fucking terrible environment. I didn't ask for this fucking life. At this point I would've rather not been born, and often wake up disappointed I didn't die in my sleep (I know many of you feel the same), because a life lived so alone is definitely not a life worth living. It's all just too much for me. When can I lay down my burdens and just lean on someone else for a change god damn it? I mean I have friends, I have crushes, I have coworkers, etc., but it's not enough. I'm constantly brainstorming for something, anything (I do have a psychiatrist and he says I'm doing all the right things, and we get along quite well compared to the many therapists I've tried in the past) that can fix this pain and frustration. \u200bSo now I'm in fuck it mode.

I ended up going over to their place and I just talked with my aunt about literally everything and just balled my eyes out, trying to get through just how much I'm hurting and feeling like I'm screaming to hold on to my life.She urged me to talk to my dad about everything, who's my best friend. The thing for me, is I love my dad more than anything, and I dont want to upset him, disappoint him, I want him to know I'm strong, so showing him how broken I am just ate me up. I didn't want to be a burden or make him feel sad or negative. I strive to make him proud of me. Its insanely important to me. My aunt and I talked some more, laughed and joked, told me a lot of her life i didnt know, and she fed me pizza and sent me on my way home for the night.The next day I woke up, and gave my dad a call to catch up, as he called when I was at my aunts the night before to check on me and see how I was feeling. So I called to talk about how the visit went, and I explained to him that after talking to my aunt, I don't think it's a bad day, I think I'm mentally not right. I think I have a mental illness and I need a professional.I mentioned I was planning on heading down to the clinic first thing in the morning to talk to a professional, but before I could leave, he showed up with breakfast. So we talked over breakfast, he came with me to the clinic, then to the hospital, and was beside me the whole time. After the hospital, he suggested I spend the night at his place for dinner and a movie night. I needed that more than I can explain. The company of my family to me, is everything, especially my father. He's the most important person in my life. I started on some medication again, I have a psychology assessment tomorrow, I'm on the path to getting mentally healthy, and most importantly, in this 72 hours, I realized the power of reaching out to my family, and how feeling their love and support is the most important thing in the world. It made the difference to me.If I didn't reach out, I don't know what I would do. I feared of leaving everything behind for real. When you really feel that way, you just want to puke. The stress was immeasurable that it just makes you unable to think straight and turns your face numb.I woke up this morning, and dad drove me back home on his way into work. Today is the first day in 4 days I haven't cried. Today I feel strong. I know I will find another job. I will keep my apartment, I know I'm going to make my dad and my family proud, and I'm going to stay strong, positive, and resilient. After reaching out to my family, I feel a thousand times more motivated.Please reach out if you are going through a hard time. Suicide might seem like such an easy way to fix a problem, but being shown the love and support of people around will remind you to keep fighting, and keep taking on each day like its your bitch.", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": {"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "rocket1811", "created_utc": 1554697311.0, "body": "Thanks man.

This may get long winded, so I apologize. I'm hoping that by laying it all out maybe someone can provide me insights I'm lacking.\u200bI guess backstory, and insight would help, so I guess I'll start with my past, maybe it'll help explain the present.\u200bI didn't come from a poor family. We were considered Middle class. My parents were 2 very different people. My mother was kind, loving, stubborn, but all in all a great person. My father would do anything for his family, but I think there are issues I have with my father.\u200bMy father, I believe, suffered from OCD, which manifested itself in different ways. In particular things had to be done a certain way, and had to be done to perfection. There was no middle ground. Either you did something perfectly, or you started over and did it again till it was perfect. My father would never hit me or my sister (throwing objects is a different story) but he'd give you this look that told you that if he wanted to, he could beat the living shit out of you. There were countless times we'd vacuum the house 5-10 times a day cause he'd find a spot we missed, or I'd vacuum the garage multiple times (brooms weren't good enough). There where many times he'd come home, and swear and yell at us, as we didnt do a good enough job. For context, I'm referring to my sister and myself at ages 8, and 5. There was not a time in our childhood that we were praised for helping, or doing all the work around the yard/house, just constant criticism. Looking back at it, I'm actually impressed at what we'd get accomplished, there were many weekends at that age we'd be in the yard for 6-8 hours cutting grass, hoeing the dirt under all the trees, edging, cleaning, vacuuming, etc. However, as mentioned, there was 0 praise after all this. We were only told about what we messed up, and how to do it better.\u200bThat perfection was a hard standard to live up to as a child, as in his eyes we were constant disappointments. This was further evident to me compared to my sister, as I don't think I was the son he hoped for. I was a fat child, and my father was the typical jock in high school type. As such we were enrolled in sports. Now, we're Canadian, and my father's 2 favorite sports were Baseball, and Curling, so naturally I enrolled in both. Luckily in my early years, despite being a fat kid, I was relatively good at these sports. My father though again, would offer no words of encouragement, only criticisms of how I messed up, and what I should have done better. Even if a game was won there was no encouragement. During practice at home, if I'd miss throw the baseball to my dad, he'd wind up and pitch at me as hard as he could (for the record, he had an offer to be a pitcher in a USA college). You basically had 3 options when this would happen; 1) catch the ball (hopefully in the netting) 2) jump out of the way or 3) get hit by the ball.The worst part though, my father was often a coach, and would praise the others for their efforts.\u200bI could go on about my father, but I think my take away from looking at my relationship with him I'm never good enough at what I do, I need to be the best, and failure is not an option. Failing at any of these 3 causes me anxiety, and stress. This wasn't really a problem in high school, but started becoming problematic for me, especially in my professional career.\u200bCurrently, I'm 29 years old, but have accelerated fast in my career, and that is likely due to the 3 driving points above, but as I continued to climb, so too did the anxiety, and stress. As I have more responsibility, the fear of failure increases; the self doubt increases; the need for perfection increases.\u200bOver the past 5 years this fear follows me everywhere. I've gotten to the point where it becomes all I can think about. I've noticed that things I've enjoyed mean very little to me now. I often partake in hobbies cause I feel I should, not really cause I want to anymore. I find I lay in bed for hours at a time, just to hide, and be alone. The oddest one that bothers me is that I don't know how to be excited about anything. This throws me off, as my fianc\u00e9e and I just took a trip, and I have others planned. I can see her level of excitement, and I'm just so indifferent to everything.\u200bThere are days, where the nagging in my head just puts me into a downward spiral. I tell myself that I'm not good enough for what I have, that I'm terrible at my job, that I'm going to lose my job, and then it's just a downward spiral of self hate. I can logically tell myself these things aren't true, but It's like I just get swept up in it. It becomes all I can think about, and I start to shut myself down, and hide from people. I start cancelling my social obligations, and just stay home.\u200bThen come the thoughts of suicide. Now, let me be clear, I wouldn't, cause I couldn't do that to those around me, but there will be weeks at a time where I go through this, and think of it on a daily basis. There are times when things flip back, and I think of it rarely, but I find those are not as frequent as I'd like. I'm sure it's normal to think about killing yourself from time to time, but what's considered too much? Am I there? Are these normal feelings? I guess it's hard to know what's normal to think about since I have no way to compare it to someone. As mentioned above, during these weeks of self hate/suicidal thoughts, I do my best to hide/minimize how visible it is, to which I find it exhausts me.\u200bAt work, I'm constantly affected by these feelings. No matter what I do, I feel I'm not doing it well enough, or that I'm on the verge of failing. I'm hyper critical of all my actions (so much so that my manager has even noticed), and highly defensive around coworkers who ask about decisions I've made. The thought of not being able to complete a project, or make a mistake horrifies me, to the point of being short of breath, and small scale panic attacks. I'm horrified that a single mistake will cause me to lose my job, causing financial ruin for my fianc\u00e9 and I.\u200bOver the past year, these feelings have intensified, I probably have suicidal thoughts at a minimum of once a week (or thoughts about how nice it'd be if say a truck hit my car, ending it all), and the sadness I feel just feels like a new norm. The stress I feel from my job is probably a mix of the nature of the job, and the anxiety that fills me from my issues noted above.\u200bSo there is a terribly summarized version of what I'm feeling. Am I depressed, is this normal? I can't really tell anymore.\u200b", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": {"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "offtherecord1409", "created_utc": 1554682882.0, "body": "I guess I just don't know what I could say that would be different from what I know.

My mom didn\u2019t do a good job with raising me. While she did give me everything, the reason why she was not good at raising me was because she spent little time getting to understand me, as I also have ADHD.I completely shattered when he passed away. I developed depression which took a toll on me. While I never cut myself, I thought it easier to just skip the punishment and go right to the trigger, if you know what I mean. (No I don\u2019t own a gun, at least not yet...)My mom is completely oblivious. Whenever I tell her that I\u2019m going to do it, she scoffs and asks me if I took my medicine (for my ADHD). She always assumes its my ADHD that\u2019s causing me to do everything emotionally, from outbursts to meltdowns. A few months ago, on November 14, the day before my Pop-Pop\u2019s death anniversary, I nearly took my own life with a knife. After Thanksgiving, I would try again with cutting myself by using tweezers to take out a blade in a razor and slicing my neck. I was alone both times. Yet I couldn\u2019t do it.A month later, December 14, I would have a complete meltdown before school starts, and just before the first bell for class. My friend took me to the counselor and eventually my mom was called in. The counselor told her that I was having suicidal thoughts, etc etc... Basically my mom was crying during the whole thing and saying \u201cI had no idea.\u201d Bitch you knew for these 5 years... Wtf.Almost a few weeks after, she would completely forget and continue to push me to being the best student ever. Because I also had anxiety, I lied to her constantly about me doing my work just to get her to leave me alone. (She doesnt know what personal space is smh) Eventually this would bite me in the ass and cause me to make up a ton of work.My mom SCREAMS at me, telling me \u201cIt\u2019s the damn phone and games! Im going to be taking them away! How dare you lie to me!\u201d Etc etc.She refuses to accept that SHE is the reason why I did it.Meanwhile her Satanic son is constantly telling me that I'm a failure, that I'm never going to succeed in college, (basically anything you can think of). I tried to tell her but she doesn't do anything about it.Edit: Why is everything gone? Nevermind that here's the rest of it:I'm done at this point. I have been crying since I started writing this out, (paused to update with a part 2 (link below), then continued crying again. She's not abusive, but hell is she insane.

Depression equals a broken brain, and now you are thinking with a broken brain, so it makes you see everything with a dark outcome.\n\n  \nOne of the positive information of this forum is that we can see successful people with a glorious past and not so successful people with a not so glorious past feeling exactly the same way. So the common feature is not our past, or who we are, or our possible future, but that we are depressed. So don't trust your brain right now, because it's broken(depressed), the same way you wouldn't trust a broken leg.  \n\n\nThe idea is to work on your brain. You said you're not in control of your life, and nobody is, however, the more you will be in control of your brain, the more you will be in control of your life. When depressed, we have those constant dark thoughts, and dark emotions, we have to try to distance ourselves from them so that we don't suffer anymore.\n\n  \nFor example, let's say we feel angry because our car broke down. Angry is an automatic signal(emotion) sent to our brain to warn us that there is a threat around and that we need to prepare for a fight, however we don't have to become this emotion(it's only a car that is broken). The idea is to receive the signal(anger) and \"look\" at it from a distance, \"This intense signal(anger) is being sent to me. Huh! That's interesting, where is this coming from in my body?\". Accept that a signal was sent to you, don't try to fight it, and look at it without becoming it.  \n\n\nWe are made of emotions, they send signals to our brain. We've never learned how to handle them, we will become the most powerful person in the world if we can handle them. And this is open to everybody, no PhD needed, no special abilities, and nobody can prevent us from doing it, it is our own mind belonging to ourselves. It is possible, it takes time because it requires practice.  \n\n\nAlso, try to get rid of judgment(good, bad, ugly, beautiful, difficult, easy,...). Life doesn't judge, life produce events, the car broke down, and that's it, life doesn't produce a miserable event, one person finds it miserable another not, so try to find it neither way. We are making our own misery when we're judging. Just see life as neutral events, because that's what they are, and your state of mind will not depend on what life brings you."}, {"author_reply": {"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "TaiHaiRhetoric", "created_utc": 1554682573.0, "body": "Thanks for you feedback though, it helps."}, "score": -2, "author": "lovinglife1214", "created_utc": 1554681568.0, "body": "Dude, I get you are in pain.

My parents stopped being home as much and stopped talking to me. I got that they we're busy. The thing that really made me mad was that I was sleeping on a concrete floor in the basement, and they refused to buy me a bed. It was cold, hard, and constantly killed my back. When u said something about it I got the whole, \"I'm in more pain than you are so yours is invalid get over it\" attitude. It only go worse over the years and I distanced myself from my parents. I eventually got a girlfriend and that kind of helped with my self esteem, depression, anxiety, all of it, until I found out something. Turns out she wasn't just cheating on me, but fucking some other dude while we've barely even hung out or gone on dates. Shortly after that my mom sat me down and told me I was a shitty son because I never spent time with them and talked to them, when THEY always yelled at me for no reason, THEY we're never home nor wanted to spent time with me, THEY never cared what I had to say because their TV shows we're more important. Ever since that I've been breaking down just about every day and been contemplating suicide a hell of a lot more than usual.

I don\u2019t have a lot of people I can talk to and even less that could relate to and understand my situation, so I\u2019m grateful that I have her to listen to me if I need her to.

It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t get it, I pretty much use sarcasm as a coping mechanism myself, but it\u2019s like this part of her takes up almost all of her personality. When I confront her about it, ask if she\u2019s alright and if she\u2019s sure there\u2019s nothing she wants to talk about with me, she often just shrugs it off with a \u201enah\u201c or makes another joke about how she would rather be dead right now. The biggest problem I see in this is that I can\u2019t tell when she\u2018s actually being genuine, I really want to support and help her, because behind her jokes I can tell how much she\u2019s struggling, but I don\u2019t know what my options are rather than assuring her that I\u2019m there for here and offering her to listen. I don\u2019t want to tell her to stop either, because I know she\u2018s already feeling like she\u2019s a burden to me and if this is her way of coping I don\u2019t want to prevent her from it.What are your thoughts on this?

I rarely ever leave my room unless it's to go to work. All I do apart from work is sit here and browse Facebook and Reddit all day, I do go out with friends occasionally but I barely say a word and honestly wish I wasn't there, since I have no social skills at all.I live in the middle of nowhere so my whole entire (almost) 20 years of my life have been isolated, those who think they are helping me are doing the complete opposite, and instead make me feel more depressed by telling me that I should move out in order to gain better social skills, yet it's physically impossible to do at my age for at least another 5 more years which I can't handle. All I think of doing is ending it all, since I see no way out from this. I try everything I can to get away from the thought but nothing ever works. I've tried looking for full on excuses to stay out the house like trying to find a girlfriend or something, but due to me having no social skills like I've mentioned earlier, and that in my eyes the large majority of girls my age seem to be living in a fantasy world where they wish everything was perfect with guys that look 100/10 makes it physically impossible to do so.I can't think of any other ideas of getting out of this week by week repeat of life since they all involve money, which I don't have, even with my job it isn't enough.I've already tried taking my life multiple times for the exact same reasons. It got a bit better but to be honest, I can't be bothered waiting, I want to go now but can't due to the pain my parents would experience.So, to help my thoughts I decided to take up smoking, so I can be happy with myself that I'm slowly wasting away to hopefully leave this world sooner one day.I don't really expect any replies on this post, I'm only making this so I don't start beating the living sense out of myself since my depression-induced rage will overcome me and I'll start taking it out on myself to extreme levels.", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "Hellcream97", "created_utc": 1554674881.0, "body": "I would strongly advise quitting smoking right now.

She lost her job, ability to work, and filed bankruptcy. \nMeanwhile, I grew up without my mom to take care of me and was raised by other people and my own means. I played in my room all day. I never had friends as a kid. I can remember feeling sad and kind of confused as a kid. Mainly watching TV shows where the protagonist had friends and birthday parties, I always wanted those things. Being a dumb kid, I thought all kids should have those things and was confused as to why I couldn't get those. Parties. Friends. Playdates. Sleepovers. I was fine socially, but I just never had friends. What would I do if I had friends? Family wouldn't let me go out by myself, with other kids who they didn't know, or their parents. \nEventually it got so bad money wise we had to move to a bumfuck state they came from.

Grandma had a stroke a few years back and needs a walker to walk and can't do anything except lay down and watch TV. Grandpa is the one who does things anymore. 93 year old. Mowing the lawn.

Pushing things on me when they don't work for her. No one can reason with me. No one can speak any sense. They don't get how I feel, and they don't want to.

I\u2019ve done a bunch for higher level science jobs after I graduated from college, most of which I didn\u2019t get. I\u2019m just getting comfortable with it now. My first serious interview was a disaster, but I learned from my mistakes. See if someone you know can do a practice interview with you. I was lucky enough to find someone to help me practice. Most interviews consist of standard questions (Why do you want to work here?, Tell is about your last job?, What\u2019s the best/worst job you have ever had? etc), come up with answers before hand. Give positive answers, don\u2019t  dwell on negative experiences but say something you learned from those bad experiences. Practicing helps tremendously.

I don\u2019t even really know where to begin. I guess I\u2019ll start with when a little description and backstory to fill in the lines.I am 25 years old, born and raised in Portland, Oregon. I am married to a woman that I fell in love with almost instantly. I have two beautiful children, a one year old boy, and a three year old  girl, but I do not get to see my daughter. Her mother and I split up a month after she was born, just packed her things and left to Washington after a blow out argument. I have seen my daughter twice since then, once during Christmas, and a random day in July of 2017. Her mother learned that I was seeing someone else, and she completely cut me off. Did not respond to calls or texts, and blocked me from all social media platforms. All while having her own new relationship with the man that now calls my little girl, dad. Now I know what you\u2019re probably thinking (because I get this at least once or twice a week.) \u201cYou should take her to court and fight for visitation rights!\u201d Yes, I really should, I want to, I need to. But something is holding me back, I want to ask for help, but I don\u2019t know how or where to start.. My biggest issues with my depression are that I completely have no focus, I get lost in my own mind and completely disregard life around me, I cannot communicate properly with other people, and lastly I have absolutely no motivation or energy, regardless of how badly I want to do something and accomplish things.It\u2019s like my mind wants to do all these great things, learn and create, but my body bogs down and I can\u2019t do anything. I want to get help, I want to do better, and I want to start fresh with a new outlook on life. I just need that initial push to seek out the help that I need.My wife is amazing, she is truly my definition on beauty, she has a heart of gold, and she genuinely makes me feel happy, but there are also issues with my marriage as well. The biggest issue is our communication, I am somewhat soft spoken and find it difficult to communicate my true meaning properly. A way for me to cope with my both my shitty verbal communication skills as well as my depression, is through comedy and jokes. Be them appropriate, inappropriate, shocking humor, morbid humor, etc. if I can make people laugh, I feel better about myself. Which in turn, makes it seem like no one can take me seriously because I just make jokes 24/7. Now, my wife is also is pretty hot headed, and will have bursts of frustration and anger. There are times when I will try to talk and communicate with her, and I will make a stupid joke out of nowhere not realizing it, and it will set her off, which I in turn causes me to feel even worse about myself because I can\u2019t get out with what I\u2019m actually trying to say. There is also another issue between her and I that I am trying to forgive/forget. Shortly after our son was born, she developed a pretty bad case of postpartum depression. She was off work for 6 weeks because our son was an emergency c-section. I was only granted a week off of work (I am a Graveyard Security Supervisor Sunday - Wednesday 6pm-6am) and most of the time was spent for recovery in the hospital. Long story short, with the new baby and working so much, I was tired. Extremely tired. And I would be sluggish around the house. Not only that, but we weren\u2019t aloud to have sex for a minimum of 6 weeks, and the best way for me to cope with that, is to just ignore the subject completely. Well, this made my wife feel extremely unattractive, and in turn, sought out the attention from another man. Like, a 43 year old dude that lived across the country. It was around three months after my son was born when I started to notice that my wife was acting somewhat cold towards me, always on her phone, never laughed at my jokes, and all in all just not acting like she actually loved me. Well, one day while browsing her Facebook photos (I\u2019m a creep that likes to stair at my pretty wife) I noticed that all her photos had an addition \u201cheart\u201d reaction, but the number was always one off of than what was shown. So, I went onto my old Facebook I had in High School and looked at her photos again, then I saw his name pop up.I asked my wife about it while I was on lunch one day, and she completely denied it. Then changed the subject by saying that she didn\u2019t feel like she was in love with me anymore. We eventually talked everything out, and were seemingly okay. About a month after that, I had an urge to look through her phone, I don\u2019t know why, I hadn\u2019t thought about it in awhile. But I did. That\u2019s when I found that she was speaking with this guy heavily. I don\u2019t honestly remember the specific messages (because I was swelling with anger at the time.) but they were speaking about sex, her beautiful, how he wants her and vise versa, etc. To shorten this long ass post up, her and I did talk everything out, and became okay again. I guess I just need a little more time to completely get over it. It just added onto my now list of insecurities on communication.TL;DRI need help with learning to communicate, as well as help starting my journey to end my depression and live life to the fullest.

All I can do is pass on what I have learned and some general good advice.\n\nFirstly that the lines between healthy valid emotions and unhealthy invalid ones can get very blurred. With all that you are going through it is understandable for you to be full of all kinds of terrible thoughts and feelings. What is hard is keeping track of where the \"normal\" emotions end and the pathological ones begin.\n\nSo at all times just try to keep track of how you feel and what you think and what behaviours they lead to. Ultimately you should make sure that you are on a journey to a better life and better health. If you can tell that certain thoughts and feelings are leading you the other way to bad habits and self destruction that try to plot out an alternative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say this is where a therapist can come in handy. CBT worked very well for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepression seems to go hand in hand with exhaustion and lack of motivation. The advice I see time and again and that also worked for me was never trying to take on more than you can manage. Start by being honest about your routine and how you spend your time then each day try to make a small improvement on the previous day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring my recovery my idea of a productive day would be on one which I found the energy to make one phone call or send an e-mail. I could do one small thing and I was done. Over time I was able to take on greater and greater challenges until I had taken care of every major issue in my life. This isn't about me this seems a typical story for people who have hit rock bottom and had to crawl back up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to communication I really struggle with it. I have noticed though that everyone struggles with it to some extent or another. It is hard enough to understand ourselves let alone explain it in a way that makes sense. People smarter than me have pointed out that the only real way to actually think is to right things down and keep writing until you really understand something. A big part of my recovery and now maintaining my mental health is writing journals and using CBT worksheets to work through my thoughts and patters or behaviour. It has been an enormous amount of work constantly journaling and writing to get to grips with everything I experience but it  has been the only way to get better at understanding myself and being able to word things in ways that make sense to others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally the hard news is that probably things wont get better until the things in your life that cause you problems and unhappiness are truly dealt with. I had to rebuild myself into a completely different person before I was able to tackle the problems in my life and with all I have learned and with all the tips and tricks and therapy and meditation and mindfulness I have accepted that nothing has been more useful in helping me feel better than actually dealing with the problems in my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope some of this helps,I don't know that any of this will make sense. What you are going through is genuinely awful and I can't imagine what it must be like to go through it.

After a year and a half (last September) my manager wasn\u2019t following cashing procedures properly and to save her skin, she blamed everything on me (the supervisor) long story short, I got fired for stealing when in fact I did nothing wrong and it was my manager saving her own job. Not only that, but she messaged my family and all the other staff started sending me abuse on Facebook. \n\nI deleted Facebook, got a new phone number and completely took myself off social media. I had no job and bills to pay. I thought everyone in this city would hate me now and I\u2019ve literally done nothing wrong.... after a couple of days of just staying in bed and doing nothing, I decided I had nothing left to live for, no family, no friends, no money, I\u2019d be homeless if I didn\u2019t get a job ASAP. So I went and bought pain killers and took around 60 and went to sleep not expecting to wake up.... \n\nFor the next 3 weeks straight, I was in the worst agonising pain in my life, what I thought would be the least painful way to go, turned into a living nightmare. I couldn\u2019t move, my back was in agony and hurt any time I moved or even breathed! I didn\u2019t even eat for 2 weeks just drank a ton of water.... \n\nThen one day I randomly got an email from my mum asking if I was ok and if I was safe due to what happened, she didn\u2019t believe what my manager had told her and that made me feel better. I got an interview the next day for a great paying job, I didn\u2019t like it and got a new one recently I love, but if I didn\u2019t get the one I didn\u2019t like, I would\u2019ve been homeless, I\u2019ve met new people, I\u2019m hitting the gym, caught up with rent and bills and feeling good again. \n\nDon\u2019t get to where I was, despite everything you might think, there\u2019s always atleast one person who cares about you. Life gets better if you let it! Talk to anyone you can that you know you listen, family, Friends, even online....

I have to be honest I see very few comments from people explaining what it's like to overcome depression and I don't know why.\n\nFirstly everything I say is purely my experience and not to be taken as absolute fact.\n\nDepression does not \"get better\", life does not \"get better\". We are all very lucky that life is anything but constant struggle and suffering all the time and for most of human history it was. My first major breakthrough was realising that to struggle ans suffer is entirely human, my thoughts that life was terrible and maybe not worth living wasn't some delusion but a pretty accurate and understandable appraisal of the world.\n\nI feel so much better than at any other time and it isn't because I was \"cured\" or because my depression just left. I don't feel healed and I all the terrible thoughts I had about the world and my life are mostly the same.\n\nOvercoming depression first meant letting go of expecting anything to work out on it's own that the universe owes me anything. I may never have friend's or find someone who really loves me or have the life i truly want. The point is that \"happiness\" real happiness should never be made dependant on anything outside of yourself.\n\nYou could have everything you want and  you could still lose it all. Rich people with all the power available to a person still fall to unhappiness. All that matters is who you are as a person.\n\nHappiness isn't even the right goal. I don't try to be happy I try to aim to be the kind of person I would really admire. My life and the world around me is full of problems what brings me contentment and meaning is tackling these things voluntarily for it's own sake.\n\nIn terms of the tools that helped me get out of my depression CBT and meditation are indispensable. I have to work daily to teach myself not to let my depressive personalty take control and lead me along and CBT is a big part of that. I recommend it to anyone who likes the idea of a therapy that gives you things to take home and work on in your own time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me I find endless contentment in knowing that whilst \"things\" might never be better, I can always be  better and that focus is the way for me to live the best life I can."}, {"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "MyNameisNotBethany", "created_utc": 1554672801.0, "body": "I can relate.

Life is completely and utterly out of your control. Let go. You are not god, you are not responsible for life, you do not have to solve anything or control anything, let it go and go with the flow. The more you resist or try to control things the more miserable and tired you get. Life unfolds itself without any persons help. Try unfolding a rose without damaging its petals, you cant, only nature can, easily and simply, effortlessly. When you let go of trying to change things, when you accept things as they are, both good and bad, life becomes more peaceful. A good thing to do is to keep your heart open to life, to others who make mistakes and most importantly to yourself. People will make mistakes, you will make mistakes, life will have bad times, this is natural, but keep your heart open to it all, allow life to flow without trying to resist or change it, acceptance brings peace even in turmoil. The way to fix this is to realize there is nothing to fix. To let go of wanting to change things, of fighting the natural flow of life. The good times will come just the same as the bad times naturally, it is your choice whether you go with the flow peacefully or keep trying to control and change things. In the mean time, personally, I believe the most important thing is to live in accord to your deepest values. If your deepest values are to be kind and loving, then try your best to live each moment with loving kindness no matter if its washing dishes or studying and you will find more peace. Think about what you value most in your heart, and live by it in each moment as best as you can, you will make mistakes again which is also inevitable and okay. But dont measure youre success so much on what you achieve in life, measure by how well your actions and live line up with your deepest values.

I just feel so empty inside. I used to be a great guy who was a track captain, marching band leader, student council, 4.0 GPA and all that. I was the golden child. But on top of that, I wanted to help out other people who are less fortunate. I used to go every week to the food pantry to volunteer, I used to stay up nights with people going through what I'm going through right now, and every summer I used to go abroad to a third world nation and volunteer in medical brigades because I used to want to work with Doctors without Borders as a career. All of this is because I believed no one deserved to suffer, but I feel like I'm one of the few people in the world who believe that and that everyone wants to see ME suffer. That really all changed when depression hit. One girl did something that drove my best friend and me apart and then that best friend went on to alienate me from everyone. That's where it all started, from there it was just a rabbit hole of getting sadder until I wasn't able to be happy at all even when things were going right. I was hospitalized twice from suicide attempts, I seek therapy but it's not helping, yall know how it is. Through many of the initial stages, I had my schools' marching band to be a support group for me. I had been kicked out of a lot of the things I was in but the marching band and the summer brigades I went on felt like the only places where I really belonged. We had a groupchat we called the \"support squad\", the marching band lost some of our members to suicide and we had all agreed to help each other out, and I used to help out others on that chat but I never really sought help from them because I didn't want to be a burden, the same way I feel right now. But one day my band friends, who I trusted more than anyone, went to my band director and spread a bunch of lies and got me kicked out. The Band director believed me, but he still kicked me out cuz I was \"too negative\".That was really it for me, even when I was positive after getting mostly cured of depression with my hospital stays, he still wouldn't take me back. No one wants me back. What's the point of even trying if I'm the only one I know who wants to get better. I feel like its a cycle of I get depressed, people make it worse, I attempt suicide, those same people cry for me and say things like \"I'm always here for you\", I get better and more positive, and then everyone shuts me out again, making me depressed, and so on. I can't go back to the hospital, I don't know what to do anymore. My parents are going to take me out of the summer brigades cuz of my dipped grades due to my lack of motivation and then I will really be good for nothing. I'm sorry for ranting, its been on my chest and I have no one to go to which is why I'm glad I discovered this. All I wanted to do was be a normal kid and help the world out. I wanted to go to parties and have fun with friends and do things like prom and mall runs but that was all robbed from me, I had to dip my own birthday party yesterday and go cry in my car because my friends will do anything to hurt me.  I wanted to be a guiding light for everyone, even more so now that I know what its like to suffer, but I'm just not the help and the great person I used to be and sometimes I feel like the best way to help everyone out is to just go away. There's just no purpose left for me besides existing, while all the people I helped are going on and achieving great things while shutting me out, I'm just there being a good for nothing useless piece of shit.

Not only that, but she messaged my family and all the other staff started sending me abuse on Facebook. \n\nI deleted Facebook, got a new phone number and completely took myself off social media. I had no job and bills to pay. I thought everyone in this city would hate me now and I\u2019ve literally done nothing wrong.... after a couple of days of just staying in bed and doing nothing, I decided I had nothing left to live for, no family, no friends, no money, I\u2019d be homeless if I didn\u2019t get a job ASAP.

I didn\u2019t even eat for 2 weeks just drank a ton of water.... \n\nThen one day I randomly got an email from my mum asking if I was ok and if I was safe due to what happened, she didn\u2019t believe what my manager had told her and that made me feel better.

I just want to get a few opinions about my current state. I don't know if this is the correct sub to ask that but I think it fits. The text might turn out a bit longer and English is not my first language, sorry for that. If anythings unclear just let me know. \n(I'm a 20yo guy, if that matters) So basically, I don't think that I'm depressed but it feels like I am, or close to being it. I know, that sounds weird, but let me explain.\n I'm a person who loves to go out with friends and just have fun, I like to make them smile and just enjoy my life. I get along with most of my colleagues as well, all together I don't have a problem socializing. I'm basically the 'oh, that guy? I don't really know him but he seems alright' - guy at your school. I don't have a problem with that, even if no one actually knows me closer. That's okay for me.\nAlso I can't complain about my life, I've got a job and a home.\n However, whenever I'm on my own and I'm not doing anything, I just feel like I'm completely lost. Usually I get home at 5pm, play guitar and do some running.. and that's it. I'm done. It's not that I don't know what to do but simply that I don't want to do anything at all. And as soon as that feeling starts my mind goes crazy and for example starts doubting everything that's gonna happen in the future and has happened in the past. And I know that it's stupid and I usually ignore it but it low-key still hits me.\nI dont get it. For example, I get home after playing Billard with my friends and instantly after I shut my door and wrapped myself in blankets it starts. And always the same questions 'why do I even care' and 'does someone actually care' and 'what if' and so on. I simply don't know where that comes from. Maybe it's because I care more about others than about myself. I actually had a relationship because of that. She had clinical depression and attempted suicide a few times, (one time in front of me, which was the first time I cried in over 8 years which isn't really normal as well) but I knew that she wasn't depressed when she was with me. She wasn't happy either, but she wasn't depressed. I obviously never told her, but it was hell for me. I didn't know if I would meet her the next day, if she would response to my texts simply because for a moment depression wanted to end it, not her. But that was a while ago, we broke up and I'm fine now, no worries. That was just an example. But that explains my mindset pretty well. I really want to help others and I'd take everything on me to make it work. It's stupid, it's not good for my health, I know, but that's something I won't stop doing and something that I'm sort of good at. \nSo, back to the actual topic, there's something else that's not normal, or doesn't feel normal. I don't show any sad emotions at all. I don't even know if I feel them  'correctly'. A while ago some family members and close friends passed away (again, I'm alright, no worries) and the moment I've got told about that I literally felt nothing at all and it really  scared me. I never thought that I could be that cold and don't feel anything at all. The only thing inside my head was 'shit, why xyz and not me'. Actually, I felt sad but not the kind of sad where you start crying. The kind of sad where you just know that something bad happened.\nAnd lastly, thinking about death. I fear death, I don't even like talking about it. I fear it because I know that eventually I'll leave someone behind who loves me and simply thinking about that makes me emotional, in fact more emotional than I felt when I heard that xyz died. I really don't think that this is normal or good. But at the same time I don't really care. I mean, I don't want to die and I want to live, but at the same time I don't care if I die. \nUsually I don't even tell anyone how am I feeling, simply because I don't think that anyone would actually care and because I don't want to put my problems onto someone else's shoulders. Sometimes I think it would help if there was someone I can come home to, simply to sit next to me and just be there. But that doesn't make any sense either. I don't want to make anyone's day worse because of me being in a mood. In fact, it all sounds stupid to me. I feel like I'm someone who just complains about something that's not important at all. People would probably say 'meh he's just looking for attention etc'. There are people who have it worse, I shouldn't be complaining.\n I've been ignoring that for years know, I never told anyone about it and I never showed it. I think it would be best if I kept doing that. Everything that I've written down kinda sums up what's on my mind before I sleep, when I wake up or when I'm alone. But for example it doesn't happen when I'm outside and just walk around, or when I listen to music. I'm still alone, but I don't think about that. Only when there's nothing for me to do and I space out. \nBut I don't think I'm depressed. I can't be, I've got everything I need, my life isn't that bad. Why would I be depressed? Everytime I think about that I always tell myself to 'man up' and get over it. Is that a sign of depression, should I look for professional help or am I just in a mood everytime I'm on my own? \nI really appreciate any comment and wish you a nice day, take care.

Im back on medication and have no help besides that. My supporter is gone and my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t help me at all. I got fired from my job since they were a government entity and didnt want liability for me. Im going into the local hospital to be admitted soon after my first attempt in years at ending it. Im hopeless and i think the depression might win this time.

With better more opportunities to advance later. It was cross country, over 800km away. That only pushed me more. I could leave my old life behind, stop being depressed, make friends and be the person I always wanted to be.I applied and after just 4 weeks I got the approval to start.I had to move into one of the most expensive cities in my country, but I somehow got an affordable place.It all just fell into my lap. I couldn't believe I had actually done it. There had to be something/someone else who had helped me.I was so ready to become my new me. It worked for just a few weeks.

When I was not at work I was on my Computer playing games and watching videos.The prospect of finally having friends and/or a girlfriend fainted so fast.Now with the added bonus of sudden panic attacks, when training got too hard. I now always have the fear: When I fail here I will have nothing. And no way in the world would the same thing as before happen again.It has been eight months.Work is still fun, but I am still alone. This depresses me once again.I wish I could just meet someone, who actually likes me, but I can't.At work, I can push these feelings behind, because I actually have fun, but once I get home I am lost.I don't know how this happened. Was it really just look that brought me here? Is there a bigger plan that still has to unfold, which will make me happy? If so: when will it happen? And why is it taking so long?

I'm hoping it's just a result of overthinking, paranoia and that its truly all in my head and it will pass soon.It's very hard to explain as its happening in my own mind so nobody would know exactly what's going on but I'm gonna do the best I can. Maybe some of you have advice.Basically during the day I sometimes get this thought that tells me I'm gonna stop feeling excited and joyful about things. It could be at a low moment or a moment when I'm actually in fact happy but its just a thought \"you cant be happy\" and it makes me unhappy instantly and I get fearful that it's true and I'm gonna stop feeling joy and excitement soon. So weird. Now, I've tried a few different techniques that have worked temporarily like telling the thought it has no power over my mind and that I just have to believe I have dominance over my mind and I can be happy, or that the thought isn't true and these often work for about 5 minutes to 30 minutes but then I get the thought again and it takes control. Essentially I'm able to convince myself the thought isnt real and I genuinely believe it to be false and so I feel happy and powerful, but then the thought comes back later only to scare me and make me doubt its false. I try to distract myself by thinking of other things about my life but the thought always comes up and sometimes even stays and I cant distract myself from it even when thinking other things. I've tried ignoring it altogether when it comes up but that usually just feels worse because then it starts actually working and controlling my mind. Lately, the thought has been coming back again and again nonstop. When I keep trying to think positive, smile or drown it out with different thoughts, it gets exhausting and I start to feel trapped in my mind, like everything around me is harder to process. Its almost a cloudy feeling like I'm out of touch with everything outside my own mind.Music, Youtube videos, Netflix, reading and meditation helps me a lot with this during my down time and it only really happens during the day. In the morning and at night I'm pretty good.But I cant have this all the time during the day when I'm out and about. When I'm walking from place to place and stuck with nothing but my own thoughts is when it's the worst. Also I dont want to just distract myself, I'd rather conquer this altogether rather than keep suppressing itAdvice on how to deal with this? It's only been going on for a few days and I definitely wanna confront it right now before it gets any worse. I'm also open to doing therapy if its needed. I hope it's all in my head and I dont have any early sign of anything big but even if I do I'd much rather know now.", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": {"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "JcDonovan154", "created_utc": 1554668226.0, "body": "No."}, "score": 2, "author": "EnnazusCB", "created_utc": 1554667566.0, "body": "Was there someone in your past who tried to shut you down or upset you when you were happy?

In other words, the organism learned that it is helpless.

In retrospect, I've been dealing with these weird feelings since around December/January, but I've only really started considering that I might have a real issue in the past month or so.  If anyone else has experienced these same feelings and it led to dysthymia, major depression, any type of anxiety, etc. please lmk your thoughts.-Lack of social interest:\u00a0Decreased desire to socialize, this has led me to be far less outgoing and motivated to meet with new ppl than I used to be. \u00a0Almost feels like I just don\u2019t have the energy to socialize with new people.\n-Decreasing social skills:\u00a0Due to less frequent and less enthusiastic socializing, I feel that my social skills have decreased because It's harder for me to genuinely be interested in conversations. \u00a0Harder for me to be as clever, enthusiastic and charismatic as I once felt. \u00a0Ofc, this leads to a negative spiral of not wanting to socialize, and even worse social skills.\n-Decreased libido:\u00a0Additionally, decreased libido/interest in talking w girls. \u00a0Libido's Still there, and can get intense at times.  It's just consistently far less than what It used to be\u2026no idea why.\n-Always feeling discontent:\u00a0Persistent feeling or mild discontent and inability to just enjoy stuff as much as I felt like I used to. \u00a0For example, watching TV shows, listening to music, movies all feel more \u201cbland\u201d now and harder to really enjoy.\nBecause of this, I often find myself not looking forward to things I believe I used to. \u00a0For example, seeing friends, parties, the weekend, going home after school, etc. because I know I\u2019ll feel discontent and sorta uneasy/unsatisfied that whole time\n-Exhaustion/sleep craving:\u00a0I find myself just craving sleep far more often than I have in the past, and getting up earlier seems to have gotten even more difficult.  I literally fantasize so often about being able to sleep in.\n-Sleep difficulties:\u00a0Unfortunately\u2026sometimes, I have trouble sleeping. \u00a0I\u2019ll frequently have random (not really disturbing thoughts, just random and racing) when I go to bed at like 11:30 on weeknights. \u00a0Then before I know it, it\u2019s 12:45 and I\u2019m still wide awake cuz of these random thoughts.\n-Adderall not as effective:\u00a0Adderall doesn\u2019t seem to provide the motivational boost, slight wellbeing and focus enhancement that it did last year. \u00a0It can actually amplify bad moods and anxious thoughts, with less effectiveness at blocking out negative distractions\n-IBS:\u00a0In October, I was diagnosed w/ IBS, which I know is potentially linked to anxiety/depression\\All input is greatly appreciated.

I grew up neither poor nor rich. I wanted for nothing that I needed. My parents were loving and did a fantastic job of raising us. I had really close neighbor friends, and made friends throughout school as I grew up. I'm told I'm handsome. I played sports for a decade, and was in band for 6 years. I showed a natural aptitude for learning early on, was placed on the fast track for academics and was constantly motivated by my teachers and parents, leading to a flawless academic record and admission to a prestigious college.That's why I hate complaining about my life, why I never wanted to admit to possibility of being depressed. I don't even have good justification to feel shitty like the rest of you. No sexual abuse, no childhood trauma, no drugs, not stupid or ugly (so they say atleast), no crippling poverty, nothing. It's just my fucked personality.I never hated myself, never thought there was anything wrong with who I was. I'm misanthropic and I'm certain I have schizoid personality disorder. I've never been thoughtful towards others, never really cared about my friends like they might've cared about me. Never bought anyone Christmas gifts, never remembered birthdays. Always viewed love and friendship as useless and fake constructions that would dissolve and turn toxic at the first hint of true adversity when people's true colors showed. I shit you not, I tried my damnedest to never smile in middle school because I wholeheartedly believed showing emotion was a weakness that could be weaponized against you. I have absolutely no idea where this line of thought came from. I thought I was better off alone. It's extremely convenient most of the time to only worry about yourself. I've only ever trusted myself. I've only ever relied on myself, and it was reinforced by the 'success' I always had in school. As is the story of many other 'academically inclined' kids, I put all my effort and care into doing well in school instead of cultivating friendships. And any time I did have to make friends, I spent it playing videogames because they were far more interesting and entertaining than friends. I didn't make a single lasting friend in highschool. Of course, if you've managed to slog through my ramblings thus far, you get the picture, and the setup. I don't want to bore you too horribly with more details. But to those of you who are reading, not out of a sense of goodwill and desire to help me, but because you want to feel less shitty about yourself and take satisfaction in the pain and struggling of anyone who came from a happier place and fell harder than you, I get you so well. I am that part of you.So the present. As you might imagine, I've never been in a relationship. Shocker I know. I'm attending college out-of-state, so I have literally 0 friends and family around. I'm unsure of my major and it causes me great anxiety. I have no one to confide in.I'm 21. My youth is gone and there's nothing to be done about it. I'm a young adult with no friends, and the loneliness is finally beginning to pain me. I've always been a loner but I was always certain any pain or unhappiness I felt up until now would've been much worse had I had friends or SOs to lose. The main problem is I feel it's too late. Too late to try to change. I've tread the road this far, and with a certain sense of spite and conviction, I feel like I should see it through.I just want to know if I should be a self-glorified martyr to a pointless cause, or if I should try to change myself to be a person who could be happier. If it's the latter, it would be nice to know if and how any of you with a similar outlook were able to change your perspective, because I'm pretty deep set in my ways.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554656639.0, "author": "Rhyvvz", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/baif0x/floating_through_life/", "title": "floating through life", "id": "baif0x", "body": "I'm on mobile so I apologize for formatting.

I grew up in an upper middle class household and was pretty much spoiled rotten. I attended a private school up until my sophomore year and transferred to a public school due to bad grades. Back then, college didn\u2019t really seem like a choice so I dove straight into my first semester in the Fall of 2014. That summer, I started my first job (an ice cream shop) I would basically work and get off late (usually around 1am) and have to be up for my classes at 8am. Being that it was my first job, I felt like I had to work at it for a while, even while attending college. I ended up failing out my first semester and my parents were really disappointed. I took a year off and just worked some shitty minimum wage job. Like I said, I was spoiled rotten so I decided to work so I wouldn\u2019t feel like an absolute useless piece of shit. Usually people would take a year off to \u201cfind what they want to do\u201d, when in reality I was just working to work. I didn\u2019t give much thought to what I wanted to do next. After that year of working, I quit and went back to school. I found that, for me, juggling both school and work was virtually impossible. So I started taking things more seriously and got my grades back up. It had been that way up until I would say the beginning of 2018. My grades started going down again and I am currently failing 1-2 of my 4 classes I\u2019m taking. (I am taking the minimum amount of credits for a \u201cfull time\u201d student because I am beyond lazy, but a part of me also feels like even one more class would just be too much to handle).  I am currently a Junior going on my 5th year of college. Even up until now, I don\u2019t have a clue what I\u2019m doing. I feel like I\u2019m wasting my parents money (which I am), and just lack motivation to finish. It makes me angry that I don\u2019t have to work to go to school and yet I\u2019m still failing out. Majority of my peers that I went to high school with already graduated and I know it\u2019s not a race but it doesn\u2019t help my state of mind knowing that I didn\u2019t finish with them.I noticed within the last 6 months that my depression and anxiety of college is more prevalent than ever. I lie awake at night wondering what I\u2019m doing with my life and if I\u2019ll amount to anything. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m suicidal, but I do have thoughts every now and then of what it would be like to just end it all....however I know that I wouldn\u2019t actually pull through with it. I just feel so stuck and in a never ending loop of college. I\u2019ve racked up nearly $30k of my parents money spent on my tuition and I feel like absolute shit that 1) I haven\u2019t finished yet and 2) i don\u2019t have the motivation or drive to.

People tend to think I'm a happy and overall funny guy because of it. I tend to make stupid jokes quite often... however whenever I'm in a really dark mood, I'd crack jokes about suicide and drinking bleach. People would just laugh at it, thinking that it's funny, when I'm secretly half-serious.I show no discernable change in my facial expression (at least not that I know of because I've never been confronted by anyone in my school, teachers or classmates about my emotional health) because I take on an unreadable, blank expression when I'm silently screaming in my own head.So... encountered a situation in which I my grade in a foreign language class dipped to a D for a single quarter in the first semester (two quarters per semester). The teacher contacted my guidance counselor, and I had a meeting with the counselor in order to discuss what was happening.  Now here comes the hard part...In truth, my grades were tanking because I could not focus in class due to a nonstop mantra of suicidal ideation in my head. Sometimes I felt like literally breaking down and crying, but I suppressed these urges in order to not make a scene that my parents would probably complain about when I get home. So the only direction my mental health and quite frankly, my future was going was downhill.I also remembered the instance in which I was nearly admitted to the psych ward; long story short, someone close died, and I kinda lost it... said I wanted to kill myself, principal called, parents didn't react very well, was hospitalized, and came back to school. All I'm going to say is that I had never felt so alone in my entire existence, and I'm a lonely piece of shit 90% of the time.So... I decided to tiptoe carefully around this one for my own sake.What I told my guidance counselor was simply part of the story, I felt like there was a crushing weight inside of my brain. It wasn't a lie, because it was true, there was a crushing weight sensation inside of my head. What I avoided to mention was the fact that the sensation originated from raging thoughts of suicide that were growing increasingly harder to control. In fact, junior year of high school was the time in which I seriously researched suicide methods. Heck, I even ditched my  gaming hobby in favor of looking up ways to just end it.I did this because... if I told anyone that I was considering suicide, it would probably make my life worse than it already was. Morbidly enough, I only picked back up academically when I told myself that I could end it whenever life grew too much. I didn't feel like I had anyone to run to, because quite frankly, I didn't think anyone gave a damn. So I could only be alone and try to survive.As it stands... I'm  a senior in high school and I don't think I have much of a future... so I'm just sitting here... waiting for my life to end while browsing memes. I feel pretty much alone in my journey; I know my problems are too heavy for many people, who, quite frankly, don't need the negativity that I carry to burden them in their lives.

If there is a better sub reddit for this let me know.Also sorry this is a long one.I (22M) just realised how badly I treated my SO three years ago.This happened when I was 19. I was going out with this amazing girl, my first GF, and everything was going great. I had just started uni, got myself a part time job and met the first girl I truly enjoyed spending time with. \nHowever, as time went on, about 4 months into the relationship, I started to lose interest in everything found myself not wanting to do anything. I even struggled to get an erection with my GF. I was feeling constantly exhausted and just found myself not wanting to get out of bed. Just felt completely disconnected with everyone and everything. Now after all this happening to me everything coming together somehow depression never even crossed my mind.\nBut I started pushing her away without even realising what I was doing. At times ghosting her for a week at a time, it wasnt just her it was all of my friends basically became a shut in. I was stressing out about uni because I wasnt doing well. I had realised I was spending more time on my job and GF than I was on my studying. I started getting filled with anxiety about fucking up uni and losing all my hard work I had put in to get where I was. Without realising it I pushed her away and we had, what should have been, a small argument about how I had been getting more distant. Instead I took offence to it because I thought she was being unreasonable, at the time. Right in the middle of my exam period to be pulling me up for being more distant when I was stressed beyond belief. I saw this fight as an escape route. But I never actually properly broke up with her. Turned out it would be the last time I would ever see her. We ended up ghosting each other, I am 99.9% sure she was waiting on me to text or call her, making me the biggest POS in existence as well creating, at this point in my life, my worst decision I have ever made. But that wasnt the real me! I am kind caring, and the last thing I would ever want to do is hurt someone that cares about me! I was just mentally fucked up and didnt even realise it.For the next 2 years after all of this happened I did uni work, which stressed me out, I played competitive video games which stressed me out, and I went out every week at least twice which made me tired. So I wasnt helping myself and being unhealthy but I just wanted to be constantly busy so I wasnt left with my thoughts.\nAt this point I was at my lowest constantly considering of killing myself failing at uni, alone with a good group of friends and my family. Not wanting to get out of bed and just completely done with life. I was still in complete denial that I had depression. How can I have depression? I have great friends and family and I'm on the course I've always wanted to do, I get food on my plate every day, I can get clean water whenever I want. What right do i have to be depressed?\nHowever, one day when I was having one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had. Worrying about all the uni work, my dissertation, my exams, my assignments, my groups projects. I didnt touch my phone and ghosted everyone. Much like I had done 2 years prior, which for the first time ever triggered a thought within me that something wasnt right.\nI was just watching shite on YouTube, as per usual, and I saw this video with stormzy talking about how depression had gotten to him it suddenly hit me like a truck going at the speed of light, if that guy can get depressed. Someone who reached peak of music, got awards and tonnes of money is depressed, then I sure as hell can get depressed.I suddenly realised that thinking of getting run over by a bus just so I wouldn't have to go to uni wasnt normal thinking. Thinking aww maybe if I just let it run over my legs just so I couldn't walk would mean I wouldn't have to go to uni. I realised too late in fact it was uni that had been my source of depression. Well fucking duh!I however, stupidly, was very embarrassed that I had depression so I hid it. \"I ain't no fuckin pussy\" I remember thinking to myself. So I didnt tell anyone. Kept going on about it my final year of uni I completely fucked it up beyond belief nailed my dissertation but failed every single class that year.I went out after my last exam, knowing I had fucked all of my exams, with my uni pals. I was in such a bad state of mind I wanted to go out get blind drunk and take every drug under the sun just so I could feel something positive for once. Looking back I think I was hoping the drugs would kill me, but thankfully they didnt. I woke up in some girls flat no idea where the actual fuck I was with her trying to pull my trousers and boxers down. I just went with it because well tbh I had no fucking clue what was going on. I kept blacking out throughout it. Turns out I had taken way too many drugs and my dick was smaller than a raisin, could have also been the depression but feel drugs were more likely for this case. She got offended that I wasnt turned on by her and she kicked me out her flat into the cold night. I would like to add that this was a rare occurrence because I hadn't been interested in anyobe sexually, other than porn, since things ended with my GF.\nI Luckily still had my phone and called one of my best pals who turns out lived right around the corner from this girls flat. He rescued me and I stayed at his.I then realised that I should get help. I told my mum and dad that I thought I was depressed and that I had been feeling suicidal and wanting to harm myself. I was so scared to tell them, now I cant think why I was scared but I was shaking out of fear. They were immediately so supportive and have been helping me through it ever since. Dad has bupa family cover so I was able to see a physiologist and I have been seeing him ever since. I now have a full time job in engineering, the field I wanted to go into.I was starting to get back on my feet, finding interests again, wanting to learn new stuff again, just wanting to do everything! It was amazing it was like I had these weights on my shoulders just lifted off and I had been wearing dreary filter glasses all that time.So I decided that I would be interested in dating again. Immediately, met this girl we got on really well. Cutting a long story short she broke up with me in a pretty shitty way, not nearly as bad as mine. Which then brings us to today I have just come to the realisation of how much of a piece of shit I was to my first GF, and frankly embarrassed how long it took me to realise it.But as I said earlier I haven't been myself for 3 years without even realising it.So here comes the questions. I wanted to reach out to her and apologise and ask to meet up so I can explain myself. But then I think I'm being selfish because she has spent the past 3 years moving on probably and I dont want to dig up her past like that. Considering how unbelievably shitty I was to her, and just heap it all back onto her. But then I feel like she deserves closure, but then is it really me that's looking for closure? Once again bringing back the am I being selfish? Is even getting back together with her a possible outcome? Would she even want me back after what I did to her? How could she trust me?I guess what I am trying to ask is what is best for her? Not to contact her or to contact her?Tldr: was really shitty to my GF, turned out it was because I was depressed and I'm filled with guilt and regret with how it ended. Should I try reach out and apologise?", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554653551.0, "author": "1_stupid_cunt", "upvote_ratio": 0.67}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bahugm/im_trapped_by_my_depression/", "title": "I'm trapped by my depression", "id": "bahugm", "body": "Why am I here?

When I think of what my future might look like, I can only worry that my depression will exponentially get worse and worse. This last year has gone by in a blur and my only two true friends have become strangers in that time. In 2017 I moved back to the states after living abroad for 2 years and decided it would be so great to move in with my best friend whom I'd missed so much each day and kept in daily contact with. Now we live merely feet apart but barely speak. She doesnt know but I've harbored feelings for her for many years now. I never felt that they were strong enough to pursue and always was happy to just enjoy being friends as we always have. (I'm also a girl for context) We have always been these two kinda platonic soul mates and sharing an apartment for the first year was honestly one of the happiest times for me. Maybe it was just bad timing but it just happened that as soon as I was dumped by my ex in a really bad break up, she met who would turn out to be her first boyfriend. (We are in our mid twenties) This was when I finally realized maybe my feelings were stronger than I ever wanted to admit. I was really torn apart by jealousy. Yes I had dated many people in the time I have known her, maybe that makes me kind of a hypocrite, but it turned out almost impossible to handle the idea of her with somebody. They have been dating almost a year now but I'm still waiting for her to come out of the honeymoon phase. You know the one where you and your new significant other fall off the deep end and forget anyone or anything else exists? This is far from my only stressor but it does still sting. I dropped out of trade school and ended up in a hospital because of my mental health. I've been taking shit jobs that I hate ever since just to keep my head above the water and barely get by financially. I have severe misophonia that has completely wrecked my life. Lost my cat recently.. Just a lot of shit has been adding up. I'm either at work or I'm in bed with my lights off just looking at my dumb phone. I had to buy a pair of new headphones just so that I could be free from hearing my roommate and her boyfriends laughter because it guts me. I feel like nobody would care if I just disappeared. Some times I think that my roommate wishes I would so she could move her boyfriend in.

It's been so long, and a journey, so boring, you wouldn't believe it.

Or playing a game, and losing just because of your luck, just because you have been matched with someone who doesn't care about it as much as you do. Imagine being called to do a job, it's finally something that doesn't involve you going out, you got a project to do, through Photoshop, and you are finally more than glad to work at something you like, but just because you are unlucky, this day out of any, your PC stops working...\u200bEvery single day, every single hour, I'd have a reason to believe that I'm unlucky. From being a simple joke to being a fact people use to describe me. It got to the point where my 'friends' are always cautious of what could happen to me, just because of how many times I got screwed because of my own luck on things so ridiculous that anyone could pass, like the one time we were in some type of abandoned theater, near a forest, and most of my friends passed a wall easily, even girls smaller than me, yet I was the only one who had stitches the day after.  So when I say that I feel unlucky, I really do, and I got my reasons for it, just avoid the ''oh it's in your mind'', because it's now, you can try and pull any bullshit like that, but it's not gonna fix the way you are treated by life. Anyways, whenever my luck decides to fuck me in a combo (of having a few bad things happen to me in a row), I just wish to get cancer and die. It became a joke within my own head, as I'd be saying it every single day, at points I prayed to get cancer just so I could quit focus from my life, and think about the end...\u200bI know it may come off as rude, I'd be more than glad to transfer my soul with many of broken poor kids who are currently in hospitals fighting in hope of waking up yet another morning, and I feel bad for them, but so I do for myself. \u200bI have less and less will to live, and I do not know what to do. I feel like I'm cursed, I do not believe in God, but there are parts of my past that make me believe that a curse has been put upon me, and it's a reason why shit's always against me.\u200bI just don't know what else to do, who else to turn to, other than 'some people online', as if I walked up to anyone of my friends and told them I was cursed they'd probably call me out for being crazy (i tried it, trust me, nobody believes you're cursed).

I do have symptoms (according to the list of symptoms) but I do not want to say for sure that I have it. All I do is wake up in the morning, force myself to go to school, come home from school and then be free until I go to sleep at about 3am because that\u2019s usually when I finally do my homework. I have about 8 hours of free time on school days because all I do is stay at home and do nothing but be on my phone, computer or just stare at something and think. I don\u2019t talk to anyone except online \u00ab\u00a0friends\u00a0\u00bb when I feel like it. Yes, I\u2019m sleep deprived. I sleep about 4 to 5 hours per night and always do an all nighter from Sunday to Monday because I never do my homework on weekends. Talking about weekends, all I do is stay at home all day. I don\u2019t talk to anyone, I just keep myself busy by doing something such as wasting my time on YouTube or reddit. Last time I went out on a weekend was a few weeks ago for a school project. I wake up at 10am, get up at 1pm because and do nothing until 5am the next day when I somehow fall asleep. I\u2019m tired of this shit. I have NOTHING to do yet I ALWAYS manage to not do my homework until a few hours before having to go to school. I constantly have suicidal thoughts whether it\u2019s 3am or 3pm. My parents don\u2019t seem to fucking care that the only times I go outside it\u2019s to go to school. They never ask \u00ab\u00a0how was your day?\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0why don\u2019t you go out with your friends\u00a0\u00bb. All they do is care about my grades and not my mental health. I do have good grades and I\u2019m not even trying! I\u2019m not smart I just have a good memory and I pay attention in class. Every time I come home all they do is ask \u00ab\u00a0so, did you get any tests back?\u00a0\u00bb  and when I tell them that I got a good grade they tell me \u00ab\u00a0good job!\u00a0\u00bb \u00ab\u00a0you\u2019ll be successful in life!\u00a0\u00bb. I feel like my mental health is deteriorating more and more every single day. I feel like it\u2019s just a matter of weeks before I snap and destroy everything around me. No, I\u2019m not okay. I\u2019ve never understood how people could have shitty grades and not come to school but now I think I\u2019m starting to understand. They don\u2019t care about anything and I feel like that\u2019s what is going to happen. I\u2019m going to stop caring about my grades and will always give back blank papers. I want everything to stop. Stop. Stop . Stop and fucking stop. I\u2019m constantly tired and feel like sleeping but I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t want tomorrow to come. Fucking hell, I think I\u2019m going to go all out. I hate people who get to see therapists. I tell them that  I\u2019m happy for them but in reality I think to myself that they must not be that depressed if they managed to get enough courage to seek therapy. Don\u2019t they feel like they\u2019re fake? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I don\u2019t want therapy because I\u2019m too afraid of it.

I don\u2019t know exactly what i need, help? Someone who understands a situation like mine? Or if it\u2019s best to just keep on holding it in until i explode somewhere away from loved ones... I\u2019ve been institutionalized multiple times as a child (8 years old-12) off and on, short term and long term. The reasoning for that was because i was out of control as a kid. I know i was miserable to be around, but it was never for a \u201cgain.\u201dWhat i mean by this is that normally a kid who was spoiled or so would most likely break stuff or be disrespectful in hopes to be granted certain things or permissions. That wasn\u2019t me, i was born into a family that never really got along with each other at all. My mom had issues of her own before i was born and from what i\u2019ve heard about my biological father the same thing was relevant in his case. I\u2019d say when i was around 4 or so years old my mother was getting me ready for bed and she ended up smacking me in the face and it left a bad bruise. Long story short i had school the next day and blah blah blah... cps was now involved. My grandmother ended up taking me in and i can\u2019t thank her enough, but by this point she had not wanted to raise kids all over again. So her patience was never there and she didn\u2019t really care to pay attention to me or my brother. She was also very naive and would believe a 3rd party rather than herself or anyone close to her. I used to have a really bad time at school and dealt with bullying constantly. It didn\u2019t matter how many times i told my grandmother, she was too busy. So then the bullying got worse, and i would eventually get into fights and end up in iss everyday. That is the only time she noticed, when she kept getting calls from the schools. You\u2019d think then she\u2019d want to question me and wonder whats going on, but nope it was always \u201ccut it out you know better\u201d \u201cwhy do you act like a heathen?\u201d So school on top of coming home and getting yelled at and grounded non-stop my depression eventually ate away at me and it would turn into anger. When i was in those moods i was in an \u201cidc\u201d mood, i\u2019d skip school as often as possible and didn\u2019t care whether i got grounded or not. It was gonna happen anyways so honestly why should i care? After awhile i was then put into counseling and they tried to get me to use coping skills and such and it finally seemed like someone knew just what i was going through for the first time ever. I would cry happy tears and loved the counselors office! It felt more \u201chome\u201d than home. The only problem was that for coping skills and stuff like that to work, my grandmother would have to do work to like hearing me out and letting me scream into a pillow. However, this was not the case. As soon as we got out of the counselors office she was back to her old self, yelling at me, and blaming me. I think she felt as though counseling would somehow \u201cfix\u201d her \u201cscrewed up\u201d grandchild that she had to take in because her daughter failed as a parent.So she resorted to other things to somehow \u201cfix\u201d me without doing any work herself on just hearing me out or trying to be involved. That is where the mental institutions began. I was in and out to no avail constantly until i was then put into long-term for 4 months and 28 days (Yes i counted.) I finally got out and was happy because even though i was out of my \u201chome environment\u201d and i should of been happy i was homesick. I always loved my grandmother even throughout everything she put me through so i was homesick regularly. I was confused by that and still am to this day.From that point on across my entire family i was now known as the \u201ccrazy kid.\u201d I was mental, nobody else was. It was as if i was contaminated, nobody wanted to be near me, talk to me, and when we lost our house and my brother and my grandmother and grandfather had to stay at the in-laws, i wasn\u2019t allowed. Luckily i had a friend and his parents decided to take me in for the time being. I would go to school and the same stuff that happened to me in 08, would still happen through junior high. At that point i just gave up. I was done, i went into the bathroom at 1:34 A.M.  sometime early january of 2014 and i lost it. Nobody was home, it was perfect i thought.I was just standing there looking at the mirror over and over forever it felt like and i was contemplating suicide... i punched the mirror hoping my fist would go through it and the jagged edges would slice my wrists. It wasn\u2019t thick enough so the mirror only cracked and my fists didn\u2019t go through so there was no cuts. I picked up a sharp jagged piece and started motioning as though i was already cutting, but instead hovering. I guess i knew it wasn\u2019t worth it and just sighed really hard... I was shaking because i really felt i wanted it over, but at the same time not.My grandfather passed later that year, and it bothered me a bunch. I was just starting my sophomore year in high school of august 2014. Well i got through around half of the year sometime in april and gave up. I dropped out, i didn\u2019t care about anything... i didn\u2019t feel a need for a suicide attempt, but if if a car came out of no where i don\u2019t know that i\u2019d be too worried. After that i stayed secluded in my room, i strayed away from anything that would involve me to be social and developed anxiety. Now i have both depression and anxiety. I have been the same since 2015, i care very little about anything. I have plenty of time on my hands as i\u2019m 20 years old now and am on ssi due to debilitating mental illness.It gets worse every day because i know i haven\u2019t done anything productive in years and i sleep to pass the time... i feel stupid for dropping out, but then again i don\u2019t. I\u2019m back and forth on everything in my life until eventually i become emotionally exhausted and fall asleep. What would appear to be normal everyday decisions society would make in an instant may take me days to weeks. That type of thinking then spirals me down into depression. I care too much about everything and need tons of reassurance on anything and feel incapable daily. Common thoughts that run through my head are \u201cwhat does your future look like?\u201d I can\u2019t answer that. My friends are out having kids and loving life. Here i am and can\u2019t even go to the grocery store without having a panic attack.People think i\u2019m lazy, and i can\u2019t explain it. I wish they knew, i really do. I try my best to hide it around company or family so maybe i\u2019m to blame for that. I just don\u2019t know what exactly it is i\u2019m here for and i need a purpose. I want to do great things, but unfortunately the only things that are great are my dreams. Hobbies that i used to love i\u2019m not holding an interest. I feel like a waste of space and it bothers me until it doesn\u2019t and i fall asleep.

However one day i was in school in 4th grade mind you. A cop comes into the classroom and asks for me out of no where, i follow him and he leads me to a room with my grandmother and my counselors.

I was finally introduced to the two counselors when i was in 4th grade. I can\u2019t remember their names, but i got along with them. It would always seem like they listened and cared. However one day i was in school in 4th grade mind you. A cop comes into the classroom and asks for me out of no where, i follow him and he leads me to a room with my grandmother and my counselors. It was kept a secret for awhile that they were planning this so i wouldn\u2019t \u201crun away.\u201d\n\n\n   I got in there and the first things that were said were something along the lines of \u201cdon\u2019t worry Gabe you\u2019re gonna be fine. We\u2019re not going home tonight, you\u2019re gonna ride with them tonight.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to think so i was kinda happy because i thought i was staying the night with the counselors or something. Well i saw my clothes packed up in the car and didn\u2019t understand fully until i started heading to Little Rock AR i knew that place because i had been there multiple times, but only for mental institutes.

I've always had quite severe anxiety, but now I'm also in one of the biggest depression episodes I have been in my life and it just goes on and on (for years). I have had many treatments over the years like medications, psychiatry, psychology, inpatient treatment when I was much much younger. I have past trauma including issues from childhood and an abusive marriage. I grew up very unhappy, feeling unsafe and very anxious. I got bullied severely at school and also by adults. I got married young and my ex husband was verbally and physically abusive and also wouldn't work for many years so I had a lot of pressure on me for years to support 2 people and take care of the house while studying for 9 years. I did a degree that is useless and nearly killed me to do it. I'm at the point now where I left my ex husband but it was a tough time for someone who finds change very stressful. I'm in another relationship, I moved in with my boyfriend, changed jobs, my dog died... literally everything from my old life is gone. I should be happy that I'm in a good relationship and had many changes. But Im so unhappy. I cry so many times a day. For years on end I feel nauseous and tired and sick every single day. I have physical health problems that contribute a lot to the depression. I feel so unwell every day and no doctor has ever helped me. I have some abnormalities but they don't think they are a huge deal.I recently saw psychologist to try and cope better but she said she couldn't help me. She said I am coping because I still go to work and said the sessions don't seem to be helping so not to rebook. I meditate, up until recently I was jogging regularly, I cook a lot of my meals, started a vegetable garden with the help of my boyfriend, I sit in the sun, I bought prepaid yoga classes to ensure I do it, I was about to join a new gym as I just moved to this area with my bf so gad to give up my old gym. It's not like I am lying around choosing to worsen my depression. I try really hard. I hold down a job and clean our house daily. So a few days ago I injured my back at work and struggled to walk at all or breathe, I went to hospital. It's improved a fair bit but the pain keeps changing places now and moving up my spine. I can't exercise anymore and my depression is so bad. I am a complete burden to anyone that knows me. My boyfriend is a caring petson but he's burned out by me because he says depression causes me to be selfish and only focus on myself. I feel like such an awful person and am not saying that for pity. I feel like his spirit would be like a smiling child who was looking forward to our future together and I just metaphorically kicked him in the face like a cruel monster. I accidentally tricked him into loving me and being with me because I was on a type of high when I left my ex husband and I acted happier and better than I was. I became reliant on romance and sex from my bf like an addiction. He probably thought I'd just stay as I was. But we've moved in together now so I'm not getting dressed up to see him and anticipating visiting each other, not pretending to be someone else etc so I'm not getting that high of that thrill so my depression has surfaced a lot more in front of him. I feel like a liar, a fraud and I should never have let him get into a relationship with me. I am so sorry that I was so selfish to do that. I ruin all mens lives who are with me. Im addicted to alcohol as well. I am a total mess. I dont want to fuck up his life anymore. I don't want to be nauseous and exhausted and in pain anymore. I dont want to keep searching for 100  ways to improve. I feel done with it all.. 20 years battling this, physically and mentally feeling so crap. I just don't have anything left. Now I have aggravated yet another area of my back from crying. There is just not much hope left. I pray and I try so hard and my health only gets worse. I just think I am ready to die now. I just dont want to do it anymore. I hoped i wpuld get better in my 20s but now it's just gone on too long in my 30s. I agree with people who say suicide is selfish but I am already considered selfish. The grief people would feel about me, I dont want to cause that bit at least they'd be free to get on with their lives without me the black cloud ruining everything. But maybe they would glorify me in my death and remember me as way better than I actually was and be sad over an imaginary version of me forever. I just wish there was a way I could check out, without hurting people. I wish I could erase their memory of me.

You'll have to adapt it to suit you situation, whether that means waiting a few years or making some tough decisions. \n\nAs it happens, when you are an adult, there is nothing but the law preventing you from doing what ever you want. It can be anxiety inducing to stare at all of the unknowns and uncertainties, and you'll be scared to the core over what-ifs, but it's true that the possibilities are endless. No, it will not come easily, but it will come.\n\nYou can end the life you have, right now, by seeking treatment and help. You can end your life, by making one small change in your day. You can end your life by finding something to love, whether that be a person, a pet, a plant, a hobby, or a laundry detergent that smells so good that you hate that your lungs can't breath in enough to take it all in. \n\nI know this sounds so insincere, or maybe like the equivalent of \"just change the things you don't like.\" Its hard for me to dig back into the logic of a depressed person, after antidepresents have given me the clarity to see all of the loops I used to be stuck in, and how easy the exits were.\n\nI guess I'll just leave it at this. If you already think that there is nothing to loose, take the courage you would have spent on taking your life, and spend it on pointing your life somewhere else.

After that, I lost interest in almost everything and anything. I used to draw, create, bake, write, cook, read, and feel so happy doing all these hobbies, but I can barely pick up a pen now and all I do to pass the time is lie in bed and watch pointless YouTube videos. Losing passion has made my university application so much harder. I had been a high achieving student before, but at the end of the year my high school results were nowhere near my expectations throughout school. I did get into a bachelor's though, but then I had no idea what to choose as a major or what I wanted to do in life. It doesnt help that my father has very high expectations for me and wants me to become a doctor/lawyer. Throughout the application process he was silent while I needed guidance, but once I randomly chose my subjects and finalised enrollment he ranted and screamed at me for being a disappointment, lazy, for choosing something that wouldn't land me a job. I live by myself now for university, and although I have friends from high school, I find it hard to connect with them and it feels as if I am wearing a mask when I'm communicating with them. I feel guilty for not being sincere with them but I know that I shouldnt burden them with my real self. I also have a hard time making friends in my classes, so when classes end I go home and go to sleep. I sleep for 10+ hours every night, I'll have 2-4 hour after noon naps as well. On weekends I spend most of the day sleeping or lying in bed watching videos. I'm severely depressed because I feel as if I have no direction in life. The course I've chosen doesn't interest me at all, and I'm not doing very well in it. The only thing that probably gives me joy is my long distance boyfriend, but everyone disapproves of the long distance, I barely get to talk to him because he works during the day, and high school relationships tend to end in the first term of uni. I'm scared of losing him. I feel so guilty for feeling the way I do. My life isn't particularly difficult, and people are often in much harder positions that I am. I feel like I'm not worthy of being helped because I feel like I'm faking it, but at the same time I desperately don't want to feel like this.

Basically find a topic, field or whatever that naturally gets your motor running. You can do this by going to random conventions, events, or anything where there is an opportunity to learn or experience something new HOWSOEVER BORING it may come across because trust me, once you do start to do this life will start to become a bit wholesome and interesting.\n\nOnce you figure out what your passion is, you automatically start to chase after it like mad. Once you start to do, you will notice a few things:\n\n\\- Time passes by so quickly you wonder where it all went by\n\n\\- You don't give any regard to things that are nonsense to you. E.g hate comments, online bullies or any other thing that brings you down because you are focused on the EUPHORIC feeling of the day that you achieve your dream.\n\nFor example, my passion is to (may be obvious but) be financially free so that I don't have to worry about meals, bill etc ever again in my life. This one dream allows me to never waste my time as wasting it is a crime to me now.\n\nGood luck on searching for your new source of inspiration buddy!"}, {"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "jumamillion", "created_utc": 1554644613.0, "body": "I think there's too much pressure to find your passion and find your dream job.

Does that make him interested in other women? Not even slightly. But do my depression, suicidal thoughts, health issues and \"constant negativity\" make him doubt our relationship? Yes. I think we will eventually end because I'm in my 30s, divorced and I know relationships become toxic if one has severe mental illness. But I don't think we will end because he finds another woman.  \n\nBut if you're young and just have run of the mill anxiety/depression/self esteem problems but you can still say plenty of positive things and act ok some of the time then people will still see a reason to be with you. It's only once you become so mentally ill and/or physically sick that you are a complete black cloud over everyone, that a man will get burned out by it just like the person suffering with it does. After years of someone being miserable and in pain every single day, it's human nature to want to be rid of them even if you love them. Like that beach movie where they all agree to live on a remote island in secret and a guy gets his leg bitten by a shark, and at first everyone is so concerned with helping him but then after days and days of him screaming in pain and ruining everyone's mood, they drag him out into the woods to let him die alone and go back to their lives. It's just human nature to want to be away from stressful negativity. But some people are too sick to maintain a facade of positivity forever.. and that's not compatible with relationships and in my experience results in the man either leaving you, falling out of love with you, becoming abusive or dysfunctional in some way. The ones that are more well adjusted will just leave.\n\nMy boyfriend always said that if I was just constant misery and he couldn't even help me then for both our sakes he would leave me. Well I am constant misery now because I am in too much pain and nausea discomfort to act normal every day. So I am regretting moving in together thinking that my brain and body were capable of more than they are, and I myself am considering my short term security and making mental plans of how I will move in with my mother when he finally ends it  as I can't be a suitable partner and love is never unconditional. If I don't commit suicide first, but I can't find a time or place where that seems suitable at all. I can't do it while living with my boyfriend.. or my mother. I think I would have to wait until my mother dies first but that will most likely be decades. \n\nSo my advice honestly is either put on a happy face and do selfless things for him, be enjoyable to talk to etc. Or if you end up ever being beyond that point then don't get in a relationship. Sorry it's not that positive but this is the depression sub and I have been through 20 years of relationships and depression and that's the reality of relationships in my experience. No one is going to love you forever as a romantic partner if you are like batshit nuts or constant misery... I mean a partnership is meant to make life easier for both people. You have to be able to put on a happy face and add something to their life. How rich or poor your family is or how stereotypically \"pretty\" you are, and crap like that, is irrelevant. Men want to be with a) a woman they truly deeply fell in love with which is complicated and not based on being pretty or rich 99.9% of the time, b) with a woman they love to spend time with and c) they can see a future with them.

When I think it was likely all self-inflicted, I then quickly believe in some very shameful things about myself like my basic worth, truthfulness, and honor/integrity as a man. From there I interact with the world from a space of self-devaluation and chalk up most if not every perceived failure or inadequacy as a result of being this rotten person. But logically this can\u2019t be an absolute truth. Ok, so then I wonder how much is manifested - as in self-sabatogiung behaviors - through the way I orient towards people and relationships from this perspective, and how much of THAT might also be a fallacy of my warped perception. I ask myself simple questions like \u201cDo I love myself\u201d or \u201cDo I love my life right now\u201d... I always know the answer to the second question (\u201cNO\u201d) but waffle on the first when I really try to drill down. I have this basic sense that I do love myself... but my life is lacking in such a fundamental way because of so many mistakes I\u2019ve made in relationships. Or did we both make mistakes? Was it really just my shit being really too egregious and unhealthy compared to what is normal? What is within normal limits for tolerating eachother\u2019s shit in relationships?

Also to note, Ken has an extremely mild case of Aspbergers.After all that, the next few months were a lot of texting/calling. Casual conversation. At that time I wasnt sure what kind of relationship he had with Angela (gf). Was it open? I admitted to him one night that I had a crush on him, he reciprocated and that changed things. I asked about Angela and he told me he was looking to end things with her, but didnt want to hurt her feelings. I told him not to string her along, and he agreed.

Angela was there 90% of the time, she came over and he would 100% ignore me and get all cuddly and schmoozy with her. I felt like I was entertaining myself, or in a uncomfortable situation. I mentioned it to him cause he seemed oblivious, and he told me she wanted to be there so he had to prove all was well to keep her happy. The one day she didnt come over we slept in bed and had sex. He had said they had an open thing, so I thought it was ok. I mentioned the fact I liked the idea of a relationship with him & he acted like he didnt want to make commitments. Remember, 'free-love' guy. The next night we (Angela too) went to a gay club and he was allll over this guy there. He was talking to me about him like \"mmm I bet he is fun ;) I got his number\". That night Angela spent the night with him and I slept on the air mattress.\u00a0 The next night, I got a call from my mom saying that my dad unexpectedly took a turn for the worst and was intubated. I went back home the next day to find he was dying. He died later that night of severe sepsis with all us around him. The hardest moment of my life.The next few months, me and Ken continued to talk. Him and Angela's relationship was still there, and he just kept saying he was intending on ending it. Then he said he would wait till he got back from Cali (a trip to visit family/Ken to meet family). He procrastinated cause he didnt want to hurt her feelings/deal with it. After the trip, he messaged telling me he did it. I was glad and glad she wasn't being strung along.After a few more visits, we talked vaguely about me moving down. At this point Ken was in a \"can't we just be\" instead of committing zone. I wanted more but tried to open up to his thoughts. I didn't want to push it. Our interest in each other grew. I was willing to see what happens. About 2 days before I moved down Ken told me casually and with happy inflection that he got the random guy that he hit on/wanted to sleep with at the bar to move in (Matt). I hung up lol. He called back like \"did I say something wrong?\"\u00a0 I told him I wasnt going to be in that uncomfortable situation again and he reassured me it is just for extra $ and he needed a place to stay. He had no interest. I accepted that. I moved down. Matt and Ken didn't do anything, they clashed and Ken couldnt stand him after a few months. Ken and I became emotionally attached. He told me he was in love with me. He often told me at random, or if I asked...that I am enough for him and he doesnt want anyone else. For the entire relationship, he instilled that. A year later he asked me to marry him...and for someone who was so afraid of commitment, that stunned me. Around this time, my health anxiety came about. I am a severe hypochondriac with PTSD like issues from excessive, past trauma. I am currently being evaluated, but multiple terms have been discussed. I have had this issue since I was 5 and it fluctuates or disappears. My folks instilled that going to a therapist would land me in a padded room. They felt it was my duty to manage my own mind. So I always severely avoided therapists. I told ken openly that I was a hypochondriac with severe anxiety and he was understanding. At this point, I hadn't had that side of me appear yet. A month later, I was on Kens\u00a0laptop. I ended up getting on the internet and went to my FB. He was still logged in and I kinda pondered for a min. I saw he messaged Sara and it was suggestive. Like, talking bout how good she was \"with your fingers ;)\" (they had a minor sexual encounter previously) and other flirty things. The problem was this was RECENT. She was discussing wanting to take him to Hawaii. That night, I showed him that I saw his msgs, and I was pissed. He wanted to sit with me and run through the convo to clarify it meant nothing. And that they always talked like that jokingly. That he thought about Hawaii, but wouldn't do anything. That he just wanted a free vacation cause he felt he deserved it after hotwiring her 3000$ 3 years before to get her teeth fixed. The whole thing smelled of BS. I then did the worst thing out of BLINDING ANGER. The worst thing I have ever done. I made a faux Sara acct spiting me in order to get Ken to stop talking to her. I was a total shit for it. The whole thing did go through and he deleted her. I didn't feel good about it, why would I? I knew I had to admit to Ken what I did, no matter the cost. I knew the consequences; leaving me, him talking to her again, kicked out, I don't know..but I was prepared for whatever, so I told him. His reaction was, like it wasnt a big deal. He wasn't upset. He told me he didnt have any interest in talking to her anyways so he was going to just keep it that way. Through the arguments over the years, seldomly I would fly off about her if we were talking about her or something relevant. Like the term \"your precious fucking Sara\" came out of my mouth a handful of times. He'd just get into IDC mode or be hurt that I would doubt his feelings/what he says. \n\u00a0\u00a0 \nA few months later my health anxiety got bad. It coincided with the wedding stress. My hobbies all stopped. All that existed was my fears. For the next few years the anxiety would came & went. I would be so out of it, that my surroundings were cloudy. Not paying attention. I would ask irrational health fears to ken which, initially he was fine with, but then it was a regular thing and he couldn't deal with it.\u00a0 His personal issues surrounding it werent getting addressed from me cause of my mindset.\u00a0 If he were to talk about how he feels and I was focused and there, it was often he would say something painful about me or us that I didnt know how to respond other than shock or sadness when he was looking for acceptance, so he thought I wasnt prioritizing his feelings. He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I would always put it off, try and get better on my own, fail, and repeat. This is something that fluctuated. I kept meaning to go, but I just got clammy and scared over it. I tried so hard to keep it in myself and not burden him cause...I didn't want to burden him with it anymore. Hes my husband, not a crutch. Throughout the on/off bouts..our lives were, good. We both worked at ACE together, a house, a great routine..and we genuinely enjoyed our time together. 5 out of 7 days Ken would wake up, wake me up with a kiss on the cheek and a snuggle in bed, get in the car, go get breakfast sandwiches, drive to work, go to a restaurant after work, try and beat eachothers score in Cribbage, go home and watch Netflix in bed, sex, and cuddle to sleep. 5 nights a week for like...2 yrs. \nThen, his folks went on a road trip to Boise and said they were looking to retire there. They wanted to fly Ken out to look at homes with them cause they wanted us to move up there too. I was unsure about this, I was comfortable, but it was an opportunity to go somewhere better and with more options. They got the house and we all drove to Idaho. I had severe suppressed/released anxiety from around February till now. A huge one. And Ken was at the end of his rope with it. We still did all the amazing cuddly, fun things together..enjoying each other but if my health anxiety seeped through, it ruined it. My sleeping habits also got severely effected, and just my general well being.\u00a0 Through this all, he always maintained that\u00a0 he just can't deal with my anxiety, he wants me to get help, lost hope, loves me, wants to be together, would never let me go, never forever. This was literally 2 weeks ago that he told me all that. In the arguments he would accuse me of being a liar, untrustworthy, selfish, childish, etc. This last Tuesday was The big Kahuna.\u00a0 Ken seemed odd. I asked him on Monday in bed what was up, if he was distancing himself from me and he took a second and told me everything was good.\u00a0 On Tuesday we went to eat dinner at some fancy restaurant, cracked some jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go do the $5 Tuesdays and he was all for that. Like totally excited, holding my hand, you know all the gooey lovely stuff. Which is normal and constant for us. I came home and gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend April and the text looked like otd be something bad about me, but when I politely asked, he bold face lied to me saying it was about something else, I could tell he was lying and asked if it were really about me and he said \"well, yes\", \"well then why did you lie to me?\", \"cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie\" and then I got angry, not cause he was talking to April about me (which isn't a state fucking secret, I really don't care) it was him lying to me. I blew up over it. He went to the movie alone, and at the end of it texted me with this\"You've never believed how I felt about you. And you're right, I didn't know how to answer your question last night..thats why it took some time to think about. I am going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with you anymore, I don't want to do things with you anymore, you're not the person I want to be with. I gave you many chances to get help, I am done and I would like you to go\"You can probably imagine how I reacted, bawled like a baby. I called him making a complete ass out of myself saying he couldn't have meant that, he loves me, Im sorry, I will go to a therapist, etc...and he just looked at me like ..get a hold of yourself. He has never said that or ever indicated EVER that he wanted that. Everytime, even weeks before he said he would never leave me, loves me too much, etc. At home i said \n\"Please, i am sorry...\"\n\"it's too late\"\n\"do you really want me to leave?\"\n\"YES\"\n\"for good?\"\n\"for now\"\n \"I will get help for real I will!\"\n \"What, you think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings for you again?\" \n\"you don't love m---??\"\n\"I am going to bed\"\n\"but..\" \n\"BED. I have to be up at 6\" (shuts door). not a tear, not a care, not even anger...just a fed up-ness.Once I got a hold of myself I wrote him an extensive text stating how I need help, and I can't pretend any longer that I can deal with it on my own, and how I can't use him as a crutch and that I don't blame him for being fed up with it, that it sucks I needed a massive push but I am going to do it and hope it betters myself as a standalone human cause I can't affect people like this. I wrote him basically that (summarized). He didn't respond Wednesday, I contacted every single therapist in town to get an appt in asap...and got one for Friday. My sister was resoundingly proud, (crying actually) that I was really going to do this. She'd only been pushing me for 20 years lol. I did everything I could to improve at the quality of my day to help clear my head. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, got a decent sleep schedule, made dinner. Ken came home, and seemed...jubilant...about his day (which is normal. His #1 priority is the quality of his day/job/hobby. He wont let ANYTHING disturb that...hence why he wants to get rid of me and went to bed mid breaking my heart. That's very normal for him. One of his biggest complaints about me in our relationship is me keeping him up past his bedtime. Like he said I dont care about his well being cause I was in a talking mood at the wrong time. Or I would be on my phone in bed and it would keep him up so I'd put the covers over me so it didn't bother/he wouldnt see. He considered that sneaky lying.) So yeah, jubilant just with his day. The bizarre thing was him being sporadically extremely nice/normal to me but also very distant. I got 1 text from him \"I am glad you go an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home\". I respected that, and didn't bother him. And went on faith.Thursday I cooked, made cupcakes, got groceries, still giving him his space. At this point in my head I was done with the 'pining' 'mindset and just...tried to find the positive in that, everything happens for a reason, and maybe my stubborn ass needed a slap to put me in the place I really need to be. So in a small way, I looked forward to my appt. I talked to my sister and she understood his need to distance himself, to say \"you know what? I am fed up, I can't do this any more unless you get help. I'm done\" but made it clear that if I follow through and really give it my 1200% and he still wants out then that is really shitty and says very little about the vows he made. I talked to April that night who basically was like \"I think he is done. I was really excited you were finally getting that help, I just don't think that hope was shared\". The next day was my appt and fuuuck. Sitting across from a woman staring at you, talking about your entire life story in order to be assessed was hard. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous. She was worried about PTSD, and it manifesting in some tangible way. She could tell I was extremely nervous and tried to calm me down. Afterward though, it felt...okay. like, I did it, and I will continue to. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me and I took that as it was safe to talk too. He was happy I went, proud maybe..but wary. He was still in that 'place' but he was really seeing I am ding my part, and will continue to. He told me spontaneously then that he started talking to Sara again. My brain went blank. like the blankest stare into nothingness. Normally, I would be upset, but I was composed (but dying on the inside). He literally handed me his phone and said I am more than welcome to look at the texts. I was not ready for it. I just got Ken to talk and then this sunk me back to an even worse place. I read the texts and I literally could not believe my eyes.\"Why did you add me again?\"\"I wanted to apologize for unfriending you years ago\"(proceeded to tell the literal entire story of when I made that fake account years ago, and how fucked up it was...the one I admitted to and he didn't even seem bothered by/said he didn't have any desire to talk to her anyway. Also told her I 'snooped' on their messages that time and it was totally \"fucked up\"....the messages he literally encouraged i read through with and was understanding about and told me I was more than welcome to look at any of his stuff to prove he has nothing to hide )\"Omg! Why would you marry someone like that?\"\"I contemplated calling it off when I found out, but I had too much money on the venue. I wanted to add you back all these years but I didnt want to make her mad, and I didnt know if it would really be you I was talking to you this time. I don't care what she sees anymore (see what?).\"\"Don't worry, she's out of my life for good, how are you?\"(and literally the following is just a plethora of giddy 6-7am conversations with him talking about how beautiful the sunrise is there, etc and many phone calls.)I was FUMED. I walked out to have a cigarette to try and compose myself. I asked him to come out and talk with me.\nMe:\"that was some painful things you said\"\nHim: \"yeah, I knew it would be tough for you to hear\"\nMe: \"Do you like her?\"\nHim: \"no, I messaged her to apologize and to have a friend back\" \nMe: \"you told her you contemplated marrying me then?\" \nHim: \"Yeah, I did..that was such a big lie\"\nMe: \"it was, and I told you flat out I did it and you let it go\" \nHim: \"well thats cause I already knew and had time to process. I actually found it on your computer.\" \nMe: \" What? You didn't tell me that\"\nHim: shrugs\nMe: Was it true about why you continued with the wedding?\"\nHim: \"I did it cause I love you\"\nMe: \"No, you said to her you stuck with it cause of the down payment on the venue\" Him: \"Stop. Why do you do that? Why do you always jump to conclusions and not take what I say? I love you and thats why I did it. The $ was secondary.\" \nMe: \"Do you really want a divorce?\"\nHim: \"I thought about it the other day yeah.\"\nMe: \"But, doesnt that even bother you?\" \nHim: \"you arent allowed to ask me about my emotions yet till you earn it\" \nMe: \"okay..I just don't understand why that extreme. We love each other.\"\nHim: \"You can be divorced and still in love. Lots of divorced people are in love...\"\nHim: \"I want to be with you. I love you. I never wanted it to get to this point, to contemplate leaving you, but I don't want to live like this (cries) with you refusing help.\" \nMe: \"I am going to someone, I am really on this. This is it\"\nHim: \"I want to see you get help and I want you back\"Later I said, verbatim \"I am going to try and be okay with the Sara thing. It hurts, i hate it, I don't understand it, but I am trying here\" and he said \"you arent going to dictate who I want to talk to or who I want to be friends with. Its none of your business\". He has made it very clear that I have to earn him back and that if I am not cool with something, tough shit. How could he say all those things? I have him back, kinda. Now he is in a...'it is going to take some time to earn my trust back but I want the anxietyless you cause I love you and I am proud you will get help' mode. I am going to continue to do my part, to do me, to fix myself...but like...I feel just...I don't even know. The Sara thing is extremely uncomfortable...and I don't know if that is something that I am overreacting over or he really is not doing right. If it is wrong what can I even say about it?Also, now Ken is trying to do stuff with me. Yesterday we went to a BBQ pit, he was laughing at my jokes, if he saw i had goosebumps he's stroke his finger on my arm and giggle or offer his coat. But at night he still went to sleep in the other room, I asked him if he was sleeping in there again and he did the whole...breathe in and 'what did I say before' look. \"I told you yesterday until you get back to your sleep schedule right I sleep alone\" then hugged me and kissed me on the forehead. He won't kiss me on the lips yet. He woke me up this morning stroking my back and kissing my head like \"you gonna get up and we can do stuff? Do you want to go shopping?\" I of course got up despite crummy sleep, pretending I am totally awake and ready. Like 5 min ago i noticed he wasn't wearing his ring. I asked where it was and he said he had put it away. I wanted to ask more about, and that is typical of me to persist a subject I am not getting a clear answer to or I want more answers to...but if I did he would give me that look again and start getting frustrated that I am doing that thing where I keep asking when he is trying to have a good day with me. And now I have these urges to look at his phone to see if he is still talking to Sara and what about now.

How has it been portrayed to you? How does its representation make you feel? How does it affect what the people around you think?Personally, I spent the entire weekend outlining articles about mental health stigmas and attitudes on college campuses for this class. \nSo, this was my response:\u201cNo, hardly at all if ever. I think a lot of stigma and myths that people form about mental health actually stems from the media. And I think it\u2019s because the vast majority of people with mental health challenges don\u2019t do anything news-worthy \u2014 just like the vast majority of the rest of the population. A story has to be pretty extreme (positively or negatively) to catch the attention of the public. We only see the very end brackets of the good and the bad represented in the news. Only the very best or very worst of people is ever portrayed in the media. But that goes for everything and everyone, not just mental health. It\u2019s because the rest of the spectrum isn\u2019t nearly as interesting as the extremes. The middle ground is what the vast majority of us experience every day so none of it would warrant news coverage. Speaking as someone with mental illness, we really aren\u2019t an incredibly interesting bunch. At least, probably not anymore so than normal people (not that I know, most of my friends have mental health issues, too). Most of us don\u2019t do a whole lot. And it\u2019s kind of hard to make headlines when you can barely get out of bed. The media massively misrepresents mental illness and the people who deal with it. It pushes myths and preys on the uninformed. We are not what the media portrays.

They all live together, get into shenanigans together, each have their own unique personalities etc.In a way i feel like this was one of the best decisions i ever made, because creating these characters has brought me a lot of happiness, a lot that i have not had in a long time (for periods of time, of course this hasn\u2019t magically cured my depression). However, i also am concerned because i fear i may get TO attached to them, since a have a history of doing so with fictional characters, and after a while of the different escapes working i usually come to realize that the characters i were so attached and in love with are not real, and that nothing like this will ever be achieved in real life.

Having used coke and speed before, stims weren't new to me and when my mate offered me a key I didn't think twice. Fuck, what a mistake.The rush I got was intense, unlike anything I'd had before, my social anxiety completely disappeared and I was insanely confident, something I hadn't experienced before. Unfortunately, I loved it so much I quickly formed a habit.Every week I couldn't wait for the weekend so I could get a gram, after a few months these grams had turned into eighths and then quarters (not all to myself but a lot) I would stay up for days, Friday to Sunday sometimes even Friday into the week, I'd only stop when I couldn't get anymore and this shit was cheap so it was usually logistical reasons why I couldn't get it.After a while I started noticing some pretty fucked up side effects, my elbows would go purple (seems others had similar side effects in the knees)), even more concerningly, I used to get a pain in my right testicle (as it seems others did too).This pain in my testicle would later be diagnosed as epididymo-orchitis non bacterial so it wouldn't respond to antibiotics, I also noticed I was having fairly weak erections, even when not on the drug; now, you would think giving the fucked up side effects I was having I would have stopped taking the stupid chemical, I tried, but fuck me did it take a while.I eventually managed to ween myself off using cocaine, cokes a lot dearer so I wasn't sniffing as much plus it wasn't as moreish and it's easier to call it a night and go home, rather than just craving more. Here's the fucked up thing, my testicle would continue to flare up in pain from the coke, now I had used coke many times before mephedrone and never had any issues but now I was. I continued using coke for about 12 months after I quit mephedrone. So I had 3 years as a mephedrone user (insanely stupid amounts) and 12 months on coke.Here's were things get weirder, once clean from everything I started noticing other things triggering my testicle pain, such as nicotine, caffeine and unfortunately Viagra and Cialis so I couldn't even do much with my floppy dick.I was 4 years clean until January this year when I relapsed on coke, probably why I'm posting this now as I hadn't thought about drugs in a long time, I hated my relapse and it made my feel dirty, also brought back memories of the state I got myself in back in 09, I was still a teenager, fuck man, I destroyed my body, I considered suicide for many years after this and to be honest, I sometimes still do.I'm now living a much cleaner, healthy life, try to eat well, gym 3/4 time a week but I'm still not right. My testicle still isn't right and my erections aren't what they should be, although have got stronger over the years.My hypothesis, and this is mine, because doctors haven't been able to give any help what so ever, as all tests have come back fine, is I've developed some kind of multiple chemical sensitivity hence why multiple things seem to trigger the pain, and that it seems to have manifested its self into some form of chronic pelvic pain syndrome.Although, I still have pain in my testicle and it's still not right, I have learned to manage my symptoms and I know by avoiding certain things (caffeine etc) I can avoid a full flare up, so I'm not exactly living in agony and I have learned to live with it, the weak erections suck but I have found I can take Cialis daily without a flare up, which is something.I haven't wrote this for sympathy or advice, just wanted to document how I got so addicted to a research chemical in my teens and I'm still having issues 10 years later.

With \"overdramatic\" I mean actually more than the usual: \"I'm depressed, I'm gonna kill myself thing.\" The difference is, this teenager A doesn't say these things out loud, they just feel them and wonders if they suffer under depression or not,\u200bAn extreme example to find it out: Teenager A climbs up a tower which has enough height to kill them. They also keep in mind, that there is enough incident where people who fell out of planes survived, i.e a death due to the a sudden stop of the accelerated fall (The fall never kills lads, it's the declaration and the force created by it, so let's be correct from the start) doesn't necessarily kill you. Teenager A considers three possibilities. They die. They survive but get crippled enough that you can't really call it living. They survive and actually manage to recover to a decent amount or fully. So, if Teenager A has depression. They would jump without hesitation. Clearly aware of those three possibilities but also overcoming the sudden fear of death which would inevitably come when they glance down, unless they jump with impulse and closed eyes. If it wasn't depression, Teenager A's knees/legs would give in and they wouldn't be able to take one step further. Fear. Not only did the three possibilities which entered their mind bothered them so much but the sudden fear of death stopped them on their tracks.\u200bWell, that's how I could describe the difference but I have no idea if I'm correct or not. It's also possible that I perhaps used the wrong terms. \"overdramatic\" = situational depression and \"depression\" = clinical depression.\u200bTheoretically, you could even go as far and say both are kinda danger.

Had sex on first grade.High school : was well-known amongst people around me, still ignored school, became intrigued by history & philosophy & theology thus started reading on books related to plethora schools of thought, started working and working out every day for an entire year and felt the sense of achievement, wanted to become a personal body trainer-nutritionist. After 18 : jobless for 6 years, went to the army because it\u2019s mandatory for 9 months on my country, stopped everything related to well-being, became depressed, couldn\u2019t handle the people on the environment because I thought everyone was mindless and not a good person inside. After the army, I engaged on gaming for countless hours, I went to study programming but this specific school had no future. I completely ignored it. Switched to major psychology on a university. All went well in the beginning but then I ignored it once again since I was living with myself and had no control of myself and I didn\u2019t discipline myself. I lost 1 year because of that. Then I passed the module. My relationship was toxic as hell, I lost the confidence with myself and gradually I became anti-social. I feel very awkward in social situations with people I do not know and I was the entire opposite a few years back. I keep many things for myself since I was betrayed by people around me. I feel very lonely nowadays. I lost my best friends but unfortunately it was not my fault. I wish none of that happened. My ex best friend A has a demeanor of a child. He has been very supportive throughout our friendship but he lost his father. I was there for him but since then he has been raging on me over meaningless matters. He always tries to belittle me. He knows I would do nothing to retaliate from his actions, he understands that he is on the wrong but he still does it. My ex best friend D is a sociopath with feelings of grandeur. He belittles everyone, mocking the girls around him, mocking his friends. He wants others close to him to do what HE desires. He is a racist thinking that a white privilege exists and should be enforced on the world. He thinks so high of himself that he doesn\u2019t take the time to criticize his actions and words or even see how others are feeling and why they act the way they do. He thinks he is God Almighty. Another ex best friend of mine called G is literally a psychopath. He had me as a friend over the years just to exploit being with a \u201cgood\u201d person and feel like normal only to toss me on the garbage once he left where we lived to exploit his family which is rich. My ex girlfriend of 2 years was an angel. On our first month. Later on she started being Over jealous of everyone, even my friends. Luckily, she doesn\u2019t have feelings of grandeur but she has so many problems that one can\u2019t even handle them. She is afraid of death, afraid of talking anything in regards to science, afraid of people around her, afraid of the entire world. She things everyone is a bad person. She is very depressed. I have been there for her through our entire time together. It is not her fault but since then, she fed me only with sorrow. She started fighting with me everyday, throwing tantrums for unimportant things 2, 3 times a day. And still, I was by her side the entire time. But then I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I told her that it\u2019s over. A few months later, she started messaging me. Being the sensitive and protective idiot that I think I am, I returned by her side but not as her boyfriend. Only as a close friend. We meet from time to time, and talk with each other almost everyday. She still is depressed, talking about how bad the world is. But at least the controlling aspect is over. My father doesn\u2019t love me, he never said \u201cgood job\u201d in my entire life. He is unemotional. To his eyes, i was always a failure. And i feel that i am becoming one. He despises anything related to an office job. My mother does, but unfortunately I can\u2019t talk with her over complicated matters. I have a brother, around 12, which plays games every day through his day, and has sociopathic traits. We cannot communicate. I do not believe in Jesus or a deity to guide me in life. I see all the injustice on our society, and why a person wants to overcome the fear of death by believing. The lust of power people have, the need to control others through giving them a purpose. But i do believe in Buddhist teachings. Which i stopped following because of the way i feel. You may think i am exaggerating but i am trying to be bold and stay true to what i say. The thing is, that i was happy a few years back, ignoring the bad things, focusing on the good things with a clear goal in mind. Help others find happiness. Now i feel that i shattered my dreams. Lately, I am surrounded by feelings of worthlessness, depression, and suicidal ideation. I  have no one around me. I have been trying to keep my depression a secret from the ones close to me. I have been spending my time on things like anime, series and gaming just so I can get my mind off of real life. I fell so bad about who i am and what i have achieved, which is nothing. I feel like I will fail university again. I daydream a lot. Being away from the capitalistic society which markets the way of life i despise, living peacefully on nature, providing on a community living outside the norms, peacefully, or even to become a Buddhist monk. But I don\u2019t know where to start, where to continue the path of my life, how to act. I truly feel, on the western society everyone is faking their friendship and attitude. I am 24 and i feel i lost a portion of my life. I feel like i am frozen. I fell it's too late.

I was so wrong - I've never regretted anything more. If I hadn't have been so ignorant when I was seventeen I'd have a degree right now - I'd be on a career path id love.Instead I live in what is essentially a glorified garden shed, bugs come through the floor, spiders fall on me in the night. And the nights, they are so cold and my bedsheets are damp, and mold grows on the walls. I caught pneumonia a few weeks ago, maybe because of my situation, maybe not - I'm not sure, but what I am sure of is that no twenty two year old girl should have to live like this.I have a partner who I've been with since that bad year when I was seventeen. Four years, it will be five this year.But he sits with his back to me in the fleeting times we do get together (he works weekdays, I work nights and weekends) - playing video games and trying to escape his own demons.I'm scared. We've been together so long now I don't know adult life without him - and yet what we want from life is so vastly different. He wants to marry, I don't, he wants his own flesh and blood kids, I don't or if I did I'd only adopt kids, he wants a big modern house in a big town or city, I want a small place in the country or off the grid  farm. He thinks his career and having lots of money is the most important thing, I think simple things and being happy are the most important (not that I am happy). Sometimes I wonder how much longer we will together until he realises how big those differences  are and leaves.So I sit alone on our bed and scroll Facebook or Reddit until I'm too tired to stay awake. And that job I have, I come home with my hands on fire from cleaning chemicals that I am dramatically allergic to. My hands are covered in scars and wounds from my inability to stop scratching them when it feels like ants are under my skin.Every opportunity that comes my way has seemed to slip through my fingers.I'm spiralling further and further down and now I feel like I don't even see the light anymore.

My issues have mainly been me hating myself, having no confidence in myself and loss of motivation to do anything. I have seen a therapist before but she left and I've been hesitant to see someone else for various reasons (I live in Bahrain). I tried to commit suicide when I was in uni but a phone call from my eldest brother helped me put things in perspective. I have to be honest I don't know where I'm going with this post but I'm pretty damn lost right now. I'm floundering aimlessly. I lost my job about a year ago but I've been able to earn money through a few investments which have been helpful for me and my family. I've never been motivated by money as I feel its just a means to an end. Problem is I've not been involved in any sort of work recently. I was a music, guitar, Economics, maths and English teacher while working in the mornings managing a trading company WHILE rocking out with my band at nights being either rehearsals or playing a show. When all that ended I wasn't too upset cos I married my girlfriend but I felt my depression creep back in and planting seeds. Right now my depression is like a giant boulder holding me back from doing anything productive. I wrote some songs and created musical arrangements (I love creating music) and I would love to be able to fill up my time with that. I am so  scared to get started and that fear pretty much stops me from ever getting started. Couple that with my deep hatred of myself and no confidence in my ability and my ambitions are pretty much dead. My weight has always been an issue and I'm the fattest I've ever been. I've struggled with weight for ages and I've found myself eating fast food everyday. Alot of my bullying has been cos of my weight among other things. It's worrying as hell cos I've got a wonderful son who was born 2 months ago. I was happy but again it didn't last long. Sorry guys I'm rambling right now and I don't know what to say but I need help/guidance/kick in the ass. I hope I've given enough background on myself and I'm not expecting much. TLDR: Been suffering from depression for years and Ive hit the lowest point right now (absolutely hate myself). Heaviest I've ever been.

Had a lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder w/ borderline tendencies. I had a brutal downturn around last December where I was absorbing a lot of psychological abuse from my boss and had an acrimonious breakup that shattered my sense of self-worth. I had a phase in early/midwinter where just thinking about my boss or my ex would send me into rage spirals that would quickly escalate into catastrophic anger and sadness. I don't know how to describe it. The anger was very all-consuming and would usually end in me feeling defeated and exhausted or stuffing my feelings with drugs and alcohol because it felt so unbearable to deal with.

Awareness increases the degree to which one may suffer, swelling the multitude of problems one has available to them.

We are built to solve problems, not to sit and be quiet. The problems solved only present us with new problems, and we end up like dogs, chasing our tails endlessly. There is nothing to build in this rotting world. Corporeal existence is doomed, as it is temporary, and survival machines, such as ourselves, take exception to our temporary nature. If there was anything to build, it would be in our head, which is the producer of the world around us. Life is a head game, whether you are on a beach in Hawaii, or the frozen plans of Saskatchewan. This is why people drink, smoke, watch TV, play video games. To reduce their awareness to a fine point. I do not blame them. Perhaps there is some knowledge which neutralizes suffering, but I know none of that. Buddhist practice is said to be the only path away from suffering by many people. But in my experience, fighting against problems, solving problems, or just the act of thought alone, only multiplies the problems you have available to you.

It's hit me pretty hard, and especially because I've had severe depression ever since I can remember. Last night I was organizing a bit in my house and ran across a drawer full of her stuff, things she had written down, pictures ect. While going through throwing what wasn't important away I began to get consumed by overwhelming emotion, flooded by memories, hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide. My girlfriend hears me sniffing from the other room and comes to comfort me the best she can, I tell her everything's okay and finally she wanders off to take a shower. I decide to gather some trash and take it to the dumpster out back, while standing in the dark alley I can't stop thinking about my car in the garage, I see my opportunity while she's distracted. As I wander back through my house I keep thinking to myself maybe I'll just go in the garage, roll down my windows, and keep the car running to see what happens, just to see where it goes. As I walk past my dogs out to the garage, my heart is racing, I feel as if I'm on auto pilot, without any hesitation I make sure my dogs stay in the backyard, go to my car, roll the windows down and start it up. At this point it feels like I'm in some kind of trance watching the as each minute goes by on my dash. After three minutes I smell the exhaust heavy in the air, I feel nothing, I act as if this was any other necessary task I needed to complete. All of the sudden I hear scratching, whining, and sniffing at the door. Immediately it feels like I somehow snapped out of whatever was happening, I pull out my phone and read a few things on carbon monoxide poisoning and start to go into a panic. So I shut off my car and opened the door. After that I felt dizzy and had a headache, I was only in there for 4 minutes, but in a closed garage I read you could pass out at anywhere from 2-8 minutes. I've always thought about it, but I've never done anything like this before. I'm really not sure what to feel or think about this. Was I serious about it? Why did I go into a panic when I heard my dogs frantically trying to get into the garage? Am I making a bigger deal about it than it actually is?

This peer pressure you sometimes feel in class? When everyone likes a certain trend and you want to do that as well so you can connect with them? That proves it.

However, his time in that band was much shorter than mine, it\u2019s hard for me to recall exactly, but I don\u2019t think he lasted much longer than a year. His exit was brought by his own actions, and drug and alcohol abuse. After that, I didn\u2019t see much of him. He started playing with some other guys we knew in the same building that we practiced in, so I would occasionally see him in the halls or stop by their room for a beer. What I\u2019m trying to say is, we were never very close.  Other than casually bumping into each other, we hadn\u2019t spent any serious time together in about 10 years. But after I got the news, it has really brought me down. I would expect to feel this way after losing a family member, not from someone that was more of a casual acquaintance. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t remember the last time I said goodbye, not knowing it would be our last. Maybe it\u2019s because I feel guilty, he had his demons and I could have done more to help. Maybe it\u2019s because the last time I did see him, he didn\u2019t see me and I made an effort to avoid being seen so I wouldn\u2019t miss my bus. That was just 3 months ago, could have been one last chance to say goodbye, or can I help...I\u2019ve been lucky enough to not have had to deal with much death in my life.

This is going to be a novel, so TLDR at bottom.My SO and I got together in 2010. We moved in together in early 2015. He'd been working for this company for about 4 years and he did nothing but complain about it. Over time he started calling out more and more. Drinking more. Losing his temper more. I felt more and more like nothing I did could make him happy. The only thing that seemed to was playing Destiny with his clan... so he did. A lot. Eventually I became so unhappy. It may also be prudent to note I am medicated bipolar, stable as I can be for the last 8 or so years. One day out of no where and over something so trivial I didn't realize he was upset he put a hole through the wall. I don't do well around agression and so I became very upset. I asked him to go to counseling with me which he refused. I began not wanting to go home. Shortly after I left him. I began going to counseling myself. We were separated for 8 months during which time I worked on myself, building myself up, finding things I loved doing, indulged in a world of self care. We ended up trying again. My one stipulation was that he stay in therapy and we go to counseling together. He had started counseling and was diagnosed depressive and began medications. He'd changed jobs and seemed so much happier. We moved back in together and then it started up again. He wasn't liking his job. He started calling out. Spent more time drinking and playing video games. He lost his job. He was unemployed for about 4 months, during which time the stress of providing for us both almost destroyed me. He stopped going to counseling because he lost his insurance. I offered to pay out of pocket because it was important to me that he continue going, but he didn't care. He got a new job. Loved it. But then stuff out of his control began happening and he hates it now. It's the same as before. I'm starting to have to coax and cajole him to go to work. The other night he drank every beer in the house, sat playing Destiny well after he was supposed to be at work, but he told me it didn't matter when he went in because no one would know when he actually worked. So two hours after he was supposed to be at work I went to bed (he works nights and I'm a teacher). I heard the sound of a beer opening and went back down stairs and laid into him. He yelled at me for about an hour. Hurled accusations and generally made me feel like a selfish, unsupportive bitch. He didn't see anything wrong with putting his employment at risk. He is adamant it does not affect me whether he goes to work or not. He doesn't see his actions as putting his employment at risk. I feel powerless and so frustrated. I feel defeat sucking at my every action. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've tried everything. I've tried being gentle and understanding, which he is dismissive of. I've tried being stern and firm, which he lashes out against. I've tried asking him what I can do. I can't make him do anything. I feel like I'm watching the third repeat of a slowmo train wreck. I don't want to do this again. What can I do? How do I help? How do I take care of myself when I feel myself not wanting to go home. How can I convey to him that is actions deeply hurt and affect me when he's adamant that they don't?TLDR: SO showing depressive pattern and refusing to seek help. Ignores there's a problem.

I currently see a therapist once a week. I'm for the most part highly functioning and half the people who know me would have no idea I'm depressed in the slightest. I have an active social life mostly revolving around music and I love it. I'm very hedonistic and live an often indulgent lifestyle which puts me in a tough spot a lot of the time and most of my weekdays are spent miserable.

I have found myself mulling on the question of is it fair to date as someone who is clinically depressed?

In your attempt to suicide post, you said your mother couldn't careless, have you considered that its because she is clueless about you being suicidal? Hell, I've been depressed for a few years now and no one noticed that I'm depressive. I avoided every social interaction with anyone, and there was a period of time when I literally stayed in my room the whole day. Still, they aren't suspicious of anything. Can't blame them though, they could've thought that I was just staring at my phone the whole time.\n\nEven if your family really doesn't care about you, you at least have one person who genuinely cares about you, and of course that person is your partner. You said you were gonna meet in July, remember? \n\nYou seem like a bright person, and actually a good one too. Its just that your depressive self has taken over the real you. I saw your comments on other subreddits, they feel like they are from an entire different person. Plus, your awareness of the world in general is better than me, I'm a 17 yrs old Malaysian as well. Despite being the same age, you seem to know a lot more than me. I mean, you dive into politics, musics, and even planned to travel to NZ by yourself. While I'm a lazy ass with social anxiety, low to zero confidence, and certainly zero talents. I can't even make the decision to try to suicide or at least self-harm to seek attention. Dude, I can't even talk to anyone about my depression. I just don't have the guts. But you are different, you are strong, and you fucking survived a suicide. Maybe there's a reason for that to happen, for you to have another chance at life. Stop thinking that your partner is lying to you when she tells you that she cares about you, because deep down, you know that you want to believe her, its just that your depressive self denies that and keep telling yourself you don't deserve her. \n\nYou also seem like you are extremely lonely in your past posts, asking for friendships in desperation. Well, if you feel lonely, the one person you need to open up to is definitely your partner. By open up, I mean to tell your partner about how you really feel, about everything, the relationship, the suicidal thoughts, the desperation of the others' cares. If you want to, you can also tell your family members, that way they can truly understand your feelings. If you aren't prepared to do something like that, you can say something is this sub to round up some confidence first. There's always people listening.

I\u2019m not really close with anybody at work because they are all a lot older than me and we really don\u2019t have a lo in common. \nI have been depressed since I was a little kid. I\u2019ve been going to therapy consistently since I was 9 years old and have been on antidepressants since I was 12. I have tried many different medications and combinations over the years, but I usually end up in the same slump.\nMost of the time I feel either very depressed, or very neutral, but I almost never feel happy or content. \nI am not good at keeping up relationships with people (not just romantic, but any kind of relationship). I try to be very nice to people and help them, usually hoping that they will show any kind of interest in me later, but usually they do not care, and I feel resentful.  I am also not good at making friends, because I am shy and scared of rejection and at this point I feel like being friends with me must be too much of a burden on other people. I envy people who have good friends or who are able to have fun because I feel like I am incapable of having either of those things.\nI have two roommates who I used to be friends with, but I do not se emu hi of them or talk to them much anymore. Both of them have made new friends and relationships, and both of them have made it clear that they aren\u2019t interested in including me in any of their activities or including me in friendships, I\u2019m guessing because I am such a drag.\nThe hard part is that I have tried to be more positive for a long time, and sometimes I am able to keep it up for certain periods, but I usually feel empty and end up in the same slump I\u2019m usually in. I have been in an especially long period without a break for a couple of years now, and it has recently gotten much worse.\nI am really not asking for advice on how to feel better because I\u2019m tired of that cycle. In fact it honestly just hurts to hear the whole \u201cit gets better\u201d or \u201cyou should try this\u201d at this point because I honestly have tried really hard and have always come up empty handed. I\u2019m more wondering how other adults have coped with feeling like this all the time? I think I always assumed my depression would let up a bit as I got older, but I\u2019ve found it has only gotten much worse.

I got to know about it on 16th December, and my mom didn\u2019t even claim her body. \nShe was my only family, and the only person I could actually rely on.

I still remember that she once had sex with boyfriend while she was with my dad, in front of me and my sister and I still have never able to forget that. She ran away 10 times leaving us, and from there my dad started having health problems from so much stress that he passed away too when I was 16. \nThen, my mom ran away again and got married to her boyfriend but was also cheating on him. My sister moved with her cuz she still loved her but my mom never cared about her and she let her do drugs as she wanted to get rid of her. \nI still remember her messaging me before overdosing saying that she really loves me and wants me to take good care of myself. And I called her as I got extremely upset and she said she is not doing anything but she lied, I told my mom to check on her but she never did. \nMy point is that, we need to take mental illness seriously.

I'm 42 and have been on antidepressants for decades. I am a functional depressive but I also struggle with substance abuse and I don't have a wife or kids, which bums me out pretty often. However, I have my own place in Brooklyn with my dog, I have a motorcycle, I have a good-paying job, get laid from time to time, and travel. So there are good things and there are bad things.Now if at any point you think to yourself, \"you don't have it as bad as I do,\" keep in mind that many mornings I wake up and the first thought in my head is \"maybe I should just kill myself.\" Sometimes I floats right into and out of my head, and then other times I actually really think about it.Today though, I thought I would post and offer some things that work for me, in the hopes that maybe I can help someone else out. Which brings me to my first suggestion:--Help someone other than yourself:\nDepression is --and this isn't your/our fault-- a self-centered disease. Helping someone else does two things:  It improves your karma (not the woo woo karma, but it makes people appreciate you, which comes back to you inevitably). Also, it gets you out of your own head, which is a bad place to be hanging out. Get outta there!  --Do something--ANYTHING--active:\nI am a runner. Even when I am depressed, I take B vitamins, load up a energizing playlist, put on shorts and running shoes, and get out there.  Hell, even if you can only make it around the block, I can GUARANTEE that you will feel better having run around the block than if you had sat home on the couch. Especially since, if you start doing a little longer exercise sessions, your body produces endorphins, which have a natural anti-depressive effect. Gotta tell ya, some of the happiest moments are right after I run.   --Spend time with friends or family (who you like):\nDepression and isolation are dangerous bedfellows. At the core of what my depressed mind wants me to believe is that I am all alone in this world and no one cares for me. (Cue tiny violin.) But really, I think those thoughts on an almost daily basis. A lot of time, however, my mind just does a great job CONVINCING me that I am all alone and no one cares. Hey, if you're on this page, then someone cares about you. so there, your mind is wrong. And if you have friends and family that you enjoy being around, don't turn your back on them just because you feel bad.  One day they are going to feel bad and you can be there to help them. Maintaining relationships can be huge mood boosters.--Talk back to your negative self-talk:\nThis might sound corny but if your mind is running you down, you have the right to defend yourself. (My therapist gave me this advice this morning, actually). The thing with our kind is that the feeling of self-pity can actually start to feel like a comfortable blanket, and we revert to it without knowing that it is keeping us stuck in our depressive loops.--Understand and be able to laugh at our catastrophic thinking:\nI am a writer by trade, and I decided last year that I would finally pursue my fiction writing like I had NOT been doing for decades. So I wrote some short stories, wrote a personal essay, got letters of recommendation, and submitted to two MFA programs. (I actually submitted both at the end of February.) I was sure that one of them would accept me; in fact, I openly talked about deciding WHICH I would attend when they BOTH accepted me.  Well, to cut to the chase, they both sent me rejection letters. Can you guess what I did? I reverted to self-pity, declared that I was no good, I was going to give up writing, and eventually even thought that I would kill myself.  Now pause for a minute. Think about that. Because two highly-rated MFA programs sent me polite letters of rejection, I came to the conclusion that I was going to end my life. Depression isn't funny, but that is fucking ridiculous.  My joke is that, I know I'm depressed when a sock falls out of the laundry basket and my first reaction is: \"That's it, I'm gonna kill myself.\" :)Hey I thought I'd give this a shot, I hope this wasn't overbearing or presumptuous or anything. I hope maybe this helps someone. Let me know if it does, and just know that, no matter how bad you feel, you are part of a community that empathizes and sympathizes with you.Stay strong. :)", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "Mjanefornow", "created_utc": 1554825601.0, "body": "Thank you.

Something really dump can peel me back to that bottom layer.\n\nI always thought the afirmation were kind of dumb. On tough days when I'm having my negative thoughts, I shut them up by chanting the things I'm good at. \"I am brave. I am beautiful. I am good.\" Stuff like that. I still think that it's kind of dumb, but I do it. When the dark voice in my head starts telling me that nothing I do is good enough, I stop it.\n\nTrying to understand how I react to things too. I'm a really sensitive person. If a friend is in pain, then so am I. If I hear a sad song and it reminds of things that happened in my past. Sometimes a sad movie.

I was expected to go to college and graduate and have a \"good\" job. I just knew she was going to freak out. I had already lost a scholarship the year before and on top of that had already collected about 20k in student loans for 2 years. To my surprise she didn't freak at all. She was very concerned and reassuring. She came to see me, took me to the beach town about an hour away and we spent the weekend there stress free. It was then that I realized I didnt even know why I was going to school. I quit after that semester and have never once regetted my decision. I'm not sure if this is true for you or not but I finally realized that the only reason I was in school was because someone told me I needed a degree.

School wasn't the best path for me and you probably could not pay me to go back and subject myself to the stress.\n\nIf you're sure getting a degree is the only way for you then it might help to just take a semester off. Re-evaluate the school you are at. Take that time to focus on yourself and what you enjoy doing. Talk to your doctor about how school makes you feel. Make a plan on how to handle the stress that comes with it. If you are absolutely dreading going back afterwards, maybe thats a sign school just isnt for you. Thats how it was for me and my mental and physical health are infinitely better because of it. I am happy with my life, and I couldnt ask for anything more at the moment - and none of that happiness came with a degree.\n\nI hope this was helpful, and I hate you're going through this shit.

On two different medications.The second psychiatrist I just saw today. Was referred when I brought myself to the ER one night because I didn't know what else to do. Was told it was for \"diagnostic clarification\". God, that sounded so good to me. Yeah, I'm on medication but almost a year later and no one has said to me \"you have X.\" I know, I know, a diagnosis can be sketchy. There's overlap. I get it. But nobody's even narrowed anything down. Literally everything in the book has been floated around. Depression, anxiety (which I remember learning in psychology were the opposites of each other???), OCD, bipolar, personality disorders, mild autism. The list goes on. I can cope anymore. It's ruined my life. My friends are currently not speaking to me because they feel overwhelmed. I wish I didn't have to talk to myself; I feel overwhelmed. I want a diagnosis of something.An appointment today. I was so hopeful. I was in for a total of 10 minutes. She told me to increase my medication...a road I was already on. That's it. I said, \"I was told this was for diagnostic clarification.\" Her response, \"well I don't know you well enough.\" Adjust the medication. Keep seeing your counselor.What the fuck??? I'm so disappointed. I feel like I was rushed out, because as soon as I got out, she took in this elderly couple who was waiting there since before she took me in. And she had said to them then, \"oh sorry, I'm running behind.\"I feel so lost in this system. Everyone expects me to take some pills and get better. Hell, some people think I don't even need the pills...just stop being so anxious and suicidal. The doctors' solution is just see the counselor and they'll fix you. I don't even know what I'm dealing with! After a goddamn year. I'm just so sad, frustrated, disappointed, and defeated.

I'll be able to call some friends there or some girl maybe some day.Also I work when I dont have exams for that up there in the text so I hope it pays off. We're all gonna make it. WE MUST.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just re-read this and I gotta say NO to depression in comfort zone. It's not good for you.

Thoughts like 'this can only last for so long before it goes wrong', 'if its gonna go south you can at least do the damage', 'you don't deserve what you have' started plaguing me which eventually led to me having a bit of a mental break when I received news of the death of a family member. \u200bAdmittedly I did a terrible thing which I won't go into and my depression is no excuse for it. But despite my ex forgiving what I did I felt that I didn't deserve her and I left. So not only have all these things happened to me but I felt like I deserve all of these feelings because I hurt others and it led me on a spiral of sorts down a darker path.

I'm in need of a lot of advice, to be honest, I've struggled with my mental health severely recently and could do with some advice or conversations from people who understand what it's like - We all love our friends and family but they don't always understand. \u200bIf you'd be kind enough to read on and then perhaps leave me some thoughts and advice? that would be fantastic. \u200bSo I'll give you a 5-year overview of how things have changed for me to give some perspective. \u200bI'm a 25-year-old British guy. \u200b5 years ago I was a relatively successful young man with his own business and an incredibly full life, most of this was around a year or so before I graduated university so I was more financially secure than most around me and thus my life appeared amazing. \u200bAfter a good few months, I found myself in a relationship with somebody I adored, it didn't take long for things to come crashing down and I found out she's been cheating on me - I had suspicion previously but she made me believe it was all in my head. \u200bAfter that relationship ended was when I really started to notice my mental health (this is around 2016?), Through friends, I ended up in a life completely surrounded by drugs and they became my coping mechanism. \u200bAt first, I was taking mainly cocaine but had regular sessions with MDMA, Ketamine, DMT, etc.  After it became apparent that my cocaine issues were spiralling I eventually reached out for help and spoke to my family about it all who forced me, despite being 200 miles away to stop. \u200bBut stopping didn't come without its issues. \u200bAnybody trying to get over a drug dependency will tell you it's not easy, to say the least, especially when you actually enjoyed your life when you were constantly off your rocker.  - perhaps this is a strong reason for why my sense of enjoyment in life doesn't match up anymore?\u200bSo, I stopped taking cocaine through a lot of trial and error but mainly because a good friend, who happened to be a pothead talked into smoking weed as a way of dealing with the cravings of coke, after all it's 'much safer'. \u200bThat cannabis dependency has lasted to this day, albeit with periods of not smoking for the odd month or two over the past  2 years.\u200bWhilst I was going through my drug tirade I gave up caring for most things, including my company and it didn't take long for that to hit the rocks and become a thing of the past that I used to enjoy. \u200bI took up some freelance marketing roles which resulted in me moving closer to my family in 2017. My family all still live in the same town as I grew up in but I've always hated the place with a passion. I struggled to make friends here as a teenager and I've struggled since moving back here in 2017. \u200bI've made one friend during this time, who initially was someone I had a 'thing' with not that long ago. \u200bJust before I moved back I was getting fairly serious with a girl, she noticed through her own experiences that my mental health wasn't right and eventually helped me talk to my family about it all, things were insanely hard for her at this point and we broke up in the summer of 2018. - I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt but she's moved on now and I kind of envy the fact she was able to get out and move on with her life. \u200bWe had a few periods where the deterioration of my mental health (Depression, Anxiety and potentially a personality disorder) landed me in hospitals on locked wards. To say I haven't been okay would be a crazy understatement. \u200bAfter we split I lost my most recent freelance contract, I can't say I was overly upset about it all because quite frankly, I hate working life, it's what lead me to start my business all those years ago. \u200bThe only job I can ever see myself being okay with is working freelance, in graphic design. I have no desire to work in any environment regardless of how 'short-term' it is. \u200bLife really is incredible, the chances if being alive are so slim to begin with and that's what has pulled me away from suicide, but I also believe that if you're working then you never have an opportunity to actually live your life as it was intended. \u200bSo where am I now? \u200bRight now I'm still jobless, I'm living off the state, if I'm not high I genuinely despise everything about my existence. I have a very weird thought process. If I'm high I don't want to be productive and ruin my high, if I'm sober I don't have the motivation to even get out of bed. \u200bIn fact, it's now 14:13 and I've been in bed all day, trying to sleep so I haven't got to deal with being awake for any more time than needed to get through the day. \u200bIn July 2019, I'll be moving across the country to the Midlands, I'm relatively optimistic about the move just because it gets me out of where I am now but at the same time It's made me approach everything with a \"things will be completely different soon so what's the point?\" mindset and I can't shift it. \u200b- I should be looking for work - I'm not. - Every day I hate smoking weed but I've found any way possible to get money for smoking and I can't stop through fear of life being unlivable, dull and lacklustre in emotion. - I don't get excited about things at all no matter what it is. - I haven't felt anything in years unless I've been high. \u200bI am currently on medication, Sertraline 200mg if you wanted to know along with Promethazine and Zoplicone. I understand a lot of this medication makes you drowsy and sleep which is most likely affecting my lack of motivation as it is. \u200bRight now, I've got a family who is incredibly frustrated with me, I'm frustrated with myself and all I seem to be doing is convincing myself with any excuse that can find for why I cannot or will not do something. \u200bIf you've made it through this far then thank you, if you've got any thoughts about my situation you'd like to leave, perhaps some advice? then I'm all ears.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554816122.0, "author": "jordthefraud", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bb7vmd/just_realized_ive_been_depressed_for_10_years_and/", "title": "Just realized I\u2019ve been depressed for 10 years and started Wellbutrin.

I was mad he wouldn't go to therapy for his stuff because he didn't think it would work but told me to go. Eventually I got suicidal again but didn't do anything because I didn't want to hurt my boyfriend. Then he didn't come home one night, went to stay with his mom. The next day he broke up with me over the phone. I broke down. I was no longer afraid to die and no longer thought he cared. I went into my medicine cabinet and took 20 pills of my sleep medicine my doctor prescribed me. The second after I did it I had regret. I called my dad sobbing told him what I had done. Then I called 911 and was sent to the hospital. Turns out the meds I took weren't lethal but they kept me in the ER for the next 6 hours so they could monitor my heart just in case. Then I was 10-13 and sent to the mental hospital for 6 days. I moved back home. I'm back in therapy, I  just put in an application for the fall to go back to a community college near where my parents live. I don't think I'm ever going to be cured of my depression.

I\u2019m still in school and see her every day, and it\u2019s just gone in a downward spiral. I make self-deprecating jokes and can\u2019t feel any emotion any more. Now, the event.So, it was lunch time and we were sitting in the cafeteria. I didn\u2019t notice that it was exactly half a year since she broke up with me, and so maybe that\u2019s why that day was cursed. So, it was the usual day of my few friends talking about stuff, and I decided to joke around and say some bad stuff about myself, which I\u2019m fine with even if people agree. But now, one friend said, \u201chey, let\u2019s prove to (me) that they don\u2019t just have 2 friends.\u201d So she asked around, and it rolled around to my ex. I was chuckling a bit, and my friend asked her if she was my friend. She went silent, then said, \u201cNo. You can\u2019t be friends with your ex\u2019s.\u201d It didn\u2019t hurt at the time, and I laughed, but later in the day it started bugging me and hasn\u2019t stopped. She doesn\u2019t know that the breakup caused my depression or that I have depression at all, and this was like the delicately put my heart back together and then tore it into even more tiny pieces. I started thinking about things and I noticed: She doesn\u2019t know my struggle. She doesn\u2019t know what I went through to try and get over it, that I cut myself a while ago, the fact that I try and try to get over it every second of my painful existence. Now... all my hard work is gone. I feel unwanted, alone, and I feel like nobody cares about me.

They are valuable tools in the fight. If money is an issue there are resources. Google is your friend. If location is your issue, take to the internet. I highly suggest physically going to one, but if you can\u2019t digitally is better than nothing. \n\nTherapy is a big part of getting better, I believe. I am also a big proponent of medication. I know it sucks buying and taking and remembering and refilling meds, but it is a small price to pay in my mind. Wouldn\u2019t you rather take some pills than feel the way you do? Don\u2019t martyr yourself over a handful of pills. They can help. \n\nYou need a psychiatrist for that bit. Once again, if money or location is a factor start googling for resources to help you. This is your life, it\u2019s worth fighting for, I promise. It may not seem like it, but there is a better life waiting for you on the other side of this fog. \n\nFinally, you are going to face the toughest enemy you have ever met: yourself. You are going to have to fight yourself to get better. It is fucking hard to do. That said, you can do it. It is going to require you to set some goals and get fucking stubborn. When everything is telling you to quit you have to dig deep and keep going. \n\nHere are some suggestions for goals. \n\nFind psychiatrist \n\nFind therapist\n\nAsk them about possible medications\n\nFollow their suggestions\n\nGet up everyday and make your bed. Shower. Get dressed. Take care of some housework. (sounds weird, but trust me. Routine, hygiene, actually doing something... all of it helps to make you feel like you are accomplishing something which will make you feel better)\n\nGo to a gym or walk (getting out, doing something, possibly meeting people. All good things)\n\nThese are just a few goals you could follow. It\u2019s up to you. You hold the keys to the cage; let yourself out.

However, things have started to go downhill lately and I've been feeling progressively worse for the past few months. No one around me notices it because I'm high functioning. I have a job, I have friends, I have a family, my beautiful puppy just turned 1 yesterday and things seem to be going well from the outside so I fake being happy because no one really understands how I feel and I don't want to bother anyone with my issues. My parents aren't very supportive of my mental health and every single time I tried telling them that I'm depressed, they dismissed my feelings and blamed me for feeling the way I feel. Having seen that I can't open up to anyone because no matter what, people will always blame me for my mental illness or just tell me to \"snap out of it\", I stopped. I became a recluse and started to actively avoid people. But now I feel like I don't know what to do to get the help that I desperately need because I've been piling up my sorrow for so long that I don't know how to talk about it anymore. The best I can do is come here and write a rant on Reddit and that's about it. I'm also discouraged by the way the mental health system in my country treats people with mental illness. Every time I chose to go to the psychiatrist, my feelings have been invalidated ONCE AGAIN. When I told a doctor that I was suicidal, she told me that I can't \"think like that\" and she told me that she won't prescribe me antidepressants. Instead, she told me to buy some supplements and see if anything changes. So I basically binge on self-harm, destructive behaviors, overeating and I'm having uninterrupted suicidal thoughts and a mental health \"professional\" refuses to even help me and treats me with such superficiality? I'm out. I don't want to see anyone anymore. I don't want to talk to people. I feel like everyone hates me and no one cares enough about me in order to help me. Even when I found a psychiatrist that somehow agreed to prescribe me a SSRI (Prozac), it wasn't successful and it only gave me negative side effects without improving my symptoms. Then I switched to another SSRI (Zoloft) and it made me psychotic and I almost killed myself because of it. Then I switched to a SNRI (Effexor) and I became even more depressed. On top of that, I thought I was legit going to die when I started tapering. I did try supplements like fish oil and GABA but nothing changed. I tried CBD oil. I tried diets. I tried cutting sugar and carbs. I tried meditation. Nothing ever helped. A few months later I started therapy and have switched between 3 therapists ever since. It didn't help at all so I gave up on therapy too (CBT). I'm at a loss and don't know what to do about it. My anhedonia is so bad that I just exist without actually living.

I may be the worst person in the world right now by accident. Even though I did not appreciate life, I always thought I was a decent person... I never thought I was a bad person. Some people might disagree but I never hurt people. I did not steal. I mainly just kept to myself and never bothered anyone. People loved to pick on me though. They would constantly tell me things like I am a psycho, I should kill myself and etc etc. It was hard for me to make friends that would respect me and for me to trust. so I kept to myself until about 2015.\u200b2015 I met a older woman. A much older woman. She told me I was cute and gave me her number. I knew getting involved with her was a bad idea, but there was always too much fighting going on in my house that I thought hanging with her almost everyday would be a good stress reliever and get away from the constant yelling of my parents. \u200bPlus she seemed nice at first. Long story short, we end up sleeping with each other for a while.  She use to tell me how her first husband was a big computer nerd and she told she was really good with computers and cell phones. She would also have a bunch of cameras and laptops and lots of cell phones that she used regularly. This info will be important later.Sex was fun at first, but then she became kind of pushy on certain things. She kept trying to get me to go down on her. She would ask all the time, and I would keep telling her no. She would get really mad about it. She would also constantly ask for unprotected sex. At this point I thought she was crazy, and I knew I should of left this woman alone, but I enjoyed being at her house too much... She eventually told me she was going to start talking to other men. I told her this was fine but I will not sleep with her afterwards. She agreed. The guy she talked to turned her down, and she tried to get me to have sex with her, and I told her no. She would keep asking day after day, week after week, and I kept telling her no, but I was ok with just being her friend. She was upset about this but  continued to let me come over. \u200bI noticed she would call my smart phone, but I could not answer it. She would do this constantly and it was weird. I would call her back and ask her if she called, and she would laugh and just say, oh I am just synching my phone with all the data in your phone. The reality is she was somehow stealing my photos, and texts from my phone by calling it and I thought she was just joking but it was real, but I did not realize  this until years later. \u200bI eventually got a new job and met a new woman and stopped talking to the first woman. I dont want to make this too long, so I will make this short. The first woman was able to contact the new woman, and taught her how to hack into my phone, and for years the new woman, watched my every move, saw every personal thing that I did, took photos, and she was also even able to get sound from my cell phone, she could hear every conversation I had. EVERYTHING. For years she was gathering information on me and I knew this 6 months after talking to this girl, and I was too afraid to leave her because I was scared she was going to try to embarrase me on the internet. after 4 years I had enough and she did just that. She went on to social media without me knowing and bad mouth me to the world, showing very personal photos of me to the world. I could of done the same to her. I had a few chances to ruin her too, but I did not, because I am not that type of person, but now I wish I did! She is so evil! She made me a villian to the world, when I am not! I am not perfect but I don't deserve this! If you spy on someone long enough, you will eventually find some bad things! Everyone has flaws!\u200bThe worst part about this is that she set me up.  How can I prove that she was able to hack into my phone? Second, I can't prove that she posted the photos on social media, because I can not find them! How do I know she did this? Because family and friends keep hinting about it to me, but they won;t tell me! And everyday, every single day they mess with my head about it! And I beg them to stop but they won't! My own family has turned against me! They hate me! They want me to commit suicide! Everyday my heart is racing! I have been set up! All because I left this girl! She is so evil! I can't stop thinking about it! She ruined me because she did not want me to be happy! She did not want to see me with someone else! She was a lot older then me and I am younger and she knew her time was up and no one would want her, and when I left her she knew she messed up and lost something good! When I left her she was miserable and alone and she wanted me to be that way too! Now she ruined my life and now she is happy! I could of ruined her life too! But I did not! That is my issue, is that I am too nice and too trusting! MY life is ruined! I can't work! I can't make friends! I can't be seen! Nothing! Just sit in my room and die! omg this is too much! There is so much more to this story, but I doubt anyone will want all the details because this is too long! I wish someone could help me!\u200bPlease value your life and realize the good in your life and do not take it for granted! I wish I could go back in time!", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "horriblemudcrab", "created_utc": 1554816239.0, "body": "Ok, ok.

Basicly to save you the time, I haven\u2019t been diagnosed with it, but i probably have a severe attachment issue likely caused by my mom, if you read the last 2-3 text paragraph you will get the primary reason i wanted to write something. The rest before that is just a sloopy presentaion of how my life turned out the way it has done. I excuse any exccesive self pity, i just feel really shitty about myself, what i\u2019ve become and how little(nothing) I have achieved.I\u2019m not a native english speaker, so forgive the many mistakes you surely will encounter if you read trough this.I\u2019m such a brokken mess of a man, if you can even call me a man. 25 years and my behavior at this point resembles an adolecent far more than a responsible young man.When did it all og so wrong? Sometimes i ask myself the same, even though i deep down know. I was born in a middleclass family, dad working full time and mom part time. I was very ill the first year i was born and I obviously don\u2019t have many memories from my earliest years. But from 4-5 years old and troughout my childhood and teenage years, what i remember the most, is the borderline toxic relationship with my mother, on my case from the second I was able to make a decision of my own. Witholding love and sometimes food, if I didn\u2019t do as she wanted. And then there was the loneliness, having a mother who was more interested in controlling your every move, then making sure I wasn\u2019t sitting around without anything to stimulate my tiny brain. My dad didn\u2019t care much for playing either, and quite frankly I just can\u2019t find the words to explain the chaos that was my family life, with me trying in every possible way to get my parents to play or entertain me, and with the respons being mild phsyical violance, a tirade of emotional and mental tortur or just simply locking me inside my room. I developed a perfectionistic way, probably as a response to my parents neglect, a hope to prove that I was worth showing love and compassion to. But in the end it made it all much worse, I flipped out when losing a board game, when doing homework(which my parents didn\u2019t mind spending time with me on). Anyway enough of my childhood, ive painted a vague picture of how it felt growing up in that house, I would throughout my childhood and teenage years always sink an extra time when arriving home from school, dreading the impending conflict that would start the second i step into the house. It shouldn\u2019t be like that, but It was.I started acting out in school around the age of 12, got thrown out of the class quite a lot, I was slightly ahead of the curve compared to my class mates at that moment and neither my teachers or I, handled that situation very well. Fastforward two years later and I get diagnosed with depression, probably due to all my social fronts being troubled( a hell of a home, trouble in school, and doing worse at my sport)my doctor starts proscribing me one pil, but with seemingly no effect, I quickly end up on 3 different pills to take every day. Not much happened but I managed trough and still had friends, primarily in my sport club. At 16 i tried commiting suicide with my pilles when i was at a trip with my sportsclub, i didn\u2019t succed only felt my heart take a single huge jump in my chest. I realised that i had to go grab a hold of the adults so i did. They called my patents and then they sent me out to exersise with the others, \u201cafterall we couldn\u2019t have the others be thinking that some could skip mandatory training.\u201dAt night I started hearing voices it just went on and on all night. next day I just lost it, and i went down to get a hold of one of the people who\u2019s voice I had heard most. I had a knife with me, but no intentions of using it, I just wanted the voices to stop, and when i grabbed hold of him and pushed the knife close to hos troat, everything suddenly dissapeared and I knew i fucked up. Unfortumay that cost me everything, all my friends at that club even the closest friend i have ever had, wanted nothing to do with me anymore. Just like that i was left with no one but my controlling mom and my slighy more active dad. Had few jobs, with not much succes and got laid of both places, and meet a girl that i got somewhat romanticly involved with, only to find out she had no other intentions than to string me along, that hurt, but luckely when we stoppes seeing each other, my infatuation with her had already dwindled a bit. I the spend 2 years on an education that i found out later that I didn\u2019t feel like working with. So started on a College education did alright the first year and got a few got friends and a solid group. One guy i was really good friends with, which at that point had been like 5 years since i had that. Anyway everything went sideways when this perfect girl(at the time) started seeing me in one of the classes we had together, so much life, while everything for me had been so dull and gray. I was numb to my feelings, but over the course of a couple of months she managed to pierce trough, and i feel for her, HARD, but i didn\u2019t belive i could get with her,\neven though she flirted a bit with me, and so my crush begun to tear me apart mentally and i got a psykosis, which gave me an impression that this great friend i had gotten (who was popular among the ladies) had gotten romanticly or at least sexually involved with her despite knowing my feelings for her. Today i know that what tought i knew was wrong, but it cost my friendship with him and the rest of the group.  When i finally couldn\u2019t handle it anymore, i wrote a long message for the girl confessing how i felt( cause that\u2019s what\nyou do when you are a social loser with no concept of how to approach women) she declined very nicely, and for a second i felt good until that same feeling of rejection that i felt a few years earlier with the other girl, and likely all the way back to my mother started pulling me down, I could barely breath, started selfharming and got suicidal and dropped out of College. I went to the doctor myself to get some help( my parents didn\u2019t know of the incident leading me to quit College since I was to embaressed to tell them. They just tought i was lazy as ussual) the doctor send me to a psyciatrist and I was in a program for two years until I was around 25 basicly relearning the simplest task such as bruishing my teeth again. They also gave me the diagnoses STPD. Fastforward to today( impressive if you have made it this far) I started College again on a quick course, while i had trouble doing assignments and attending my classes I did well in the exam, and got top grade i 2 exams a medium in 1 and just passed the last one. I still had worries, how was I supposed to get a job if I wasn\u2019t more consistent then what i had been, but i kept going, had no other choice. The years following my breakdown over that last girl had gotten me back into the \u201cnumb\u201d mode I wasn\u2019t happy and I wouldn\u2019t mind dying, but i wasn\u2019t suicidal. Knowing my luck by now, you probably know, that it was about to change. My new teacher walked in, perhaps 5-6 years older than me, so much joy, exitment and willingness to see the best in people. Quickly i became infatuated but it wasn\u2019t until i started noticing that feeling of a crush building up that i got nervous. I tried pulling away because i knew that there was no happy ending for my beggining crush, but to no avail. So i was plunged into a deep depression, with selfharm and a very though out plan of commiting suicide. But right now what pains me the most, isn\u2019t my miserable existense which seems to just go in somewhat of a \u201cloop\u201d. Nor is it my depression making me hate every second i have to keep living. No it\u2019s how far i have truly fallen when i last night decided to convert my saddnes over not being able to get her(she\u2019s got a stable relationship).So i wrote her a message complaining about her way of teaching and that i wasn\u2019t gonna show up for anymore of her classes. Some of my concerns i belive are valid, but not in any way to the extend that I made it seem in my message. She is probably one of the, if not the best teacher ive had, and I know it\u2019s my own fault for not being ready for the exam, i\u2019m the one to have skipped classes, made no effort when actually being present. I suppose I hoped she would come talk to me, but she didn\u2019t, she is probably thinking that i\u2019m just a lazy sloop who didn\u2019t care for school and who dislikes her. I could have just asked her to talk, she would probably have agreed,If only i wasn\u2019t so proud\nand ashamed of my strugglesTroughout my 25 years, no matter how bad i\u2019ve been, I have always been fair, kind and not put my own issues upon others. That changed last night and i\u2019m deeply ashamed and I can hardly muster the courage to check if she has answered my message.", "top_comments": [], "created_utc": 1554798009.0, "author": "Depressedman93", "upvote_ratio": 0.67}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bb5inu/someone_i_dont_know_very_well_is_posting_a_lot_of/", "title": "Someone I don\u2019t know very well is posting a lot of depression related memes on their Instagram, should I message them?", "id": "bb5inu", "body": "A girl I know from school who I\u2019ve also chatted to at a club once is posting a lot of things on her instagram indicating she has depression and no one cares about her.

Some people feel things differently. Some are affected by certain events that haunt them, some are emotional that they are lonely, some think everyone hates them, etc.\n\nPeople are really caught up in their feelings. Every person has a different flavour to their depression. Some feel better with therapy, some get better in a relationship, some feel great after crying, some never recover.

I had a natural gift for psychology, reading a looooooot of books brought new concepts. These concepts helped me pick up the pieces of the puzzle and get why I feel like this, I have mapped out most of my life. I know why everything is happening, I know what made me feel x, I know what made me feel y. On paper, I know how to counteract almost every single thing in my brain, but... It only goes so far. To me, there are moments where I simply can't think my way out of the darkness. Instead of sitting there, processing and shoving the bad thoughts out, emotions take over. Think of it like, your in a small room, it's cozy, nice. You're relaxed on a couch trying to think. At that moment, outside comes the darkness. Hurricanes, bomb dropping non stop, random lightning bolts that are loud, really loud screeching sirens, whatever, all at the same time... As cozy as you might feel in the room trying to focus, you can't. Ideally, you try to turn off every single thing. Sirens, bombs, this, that...

What to do?", "id": "bb5q6p", "body": "Hello everyone!I started dating this girl 12 months ago. At first, I wasn't particularly interested but gave her a chance! It took us a few months and a long summer break of not seeing each other (we were in different countries) to get together. I thought: let's give it a try! She was completely into me and unbelievably happy that we finally got together. Over the course of our relationship I really fell in love with her, but I realised that there was something a bit odd. She often lacked energy and I felt like she just didn't enjoy spending time with me that much, that she preferred being with her friends. I decided to confront her about this and told her that I felt like she was not really there for me in the way I would expect a GF to be. Following this conversation she said, \"you are right, but let's talk about tonight\". That night, I went over to her place and she told me that she had been was suffering from severe depression even before our relationship and that she couldn't \"hold the responsibility\" to care for me any longer. She told me that she feels like we are destined for each other and that we fit so well to one another, but that I deserved better; someone healthy. She told me that it was unfair on me to spend time with me whilst she felt good and not do so, when she was feeling bad. Overall she feels incredibly guilty towards me. She told me that during the time we didn't see each other at the beginning of our dating period (over the summer break), she had a severe depressive episode. The first in her life (she is 21). She went to see a therapists who immediately begged for her to go into a clinic for 3 months and that she could never start a relationship now. My GF didn't listen and got together with me. She told me that at first everything was amazing, her depression seemed to get better. However, things started to change and she felt guilty for making up excuses when going to see her therapist and not me. She had never told anyone that she was depressed, she always pretends to be this happy extroverted girl. It got too much for her with me and she told me everything, I am now the only person that knows everything about her. Let me now try to explain where her depression might come from: My GF was born into an environment of absolute neglect. Her father wanted to abort her and then left her mother when my GF was born. Her mother, struggling with depression herself, was completely overwhelmed and never cared for her. Her mother escaped into work and was never there. The only person that cared was her grandmother, who has now been diagnosed with Alzheimers.. Overall really sad. Furthermore my GF is an only child. The terrible thing is that not only did she lack receiving love, she also received emotional abuse. For example, her mother made her go away, when she wanted to be with her boyfriends. Her father constantly tells her that she is worthless and that the spoilt life she is leading is shocking and that he would have never lead such a life ect. What I tried to do: I fully respected her breakup decision but sent her a couple of love lettres over the course of the next month. I didn't know anything about depression at that time. So these letters were maybe a bit too romantic for her. However, I wrote that I am waiting for her to get better and that I am there for her. After a couple of months we met up again and I said that I didn't expect anything from her, that I was there for her unconditionally. I really tried to take the pressure and guilt away from her. I told her that she doesn't need to feel guilty and that I was fine, that I loved her over the moon ect. She thanked me so much, started crying but said that we still can't be together with me. I fully understood and accepted this. Over the next month we went out for lunch, which was really nice and full of love again. However, since about 3 weeks ago, she turned a cold shoulder on me. Canceling a lunch date and the postponing it, only to cancel it again. She told me that she was feeling really bad and wouldn't be much of a benefit to me. I reminded her that I was there for her unconditionally and that I don't expect anything from her. We had a phone call the following week, where I asked how she was doing? How it feels for her to be around me? The call lasted 15 mins. She said she didn't want to talk about how she felt and she kind of pushed me away. My struggle: I really want to be there for her, because I see a future in us. But I don't know what to do about her turning cold on me. She almost never reaches out to me. And it seems as if she is trying to get away from me sometimes. Bare in mind that since our breakup 3 months ago, we have seen each other 3 times, had 1 phone call and I texted her 5-6 times. So I really din't push her. My GF will be doing an intensive clinic retreat in about 2 months. I know that until then, we won't get back together. But do you think, because she has been so unresponsive, that she wants me to go away for good? Does it mean anything, that she turns such a cod shoulder on me?

My one problem in life is not being able to connect with people. For some time I assumed I was a psychopath, but I don't meet the descriptions I've read online. That leads me to believe that there's something else going on.I've never had a gf and never even attempted to look for one. I've even kept my distance from any male friend that has gotten \"too close\" (because I fear they could find out). My best friend in high school knew there was something wrong and called me out on it. Tried to help. Soon after, I changed my phone number and told my parents that they're not allowed to tell him where I was or how to contact me. Fast forward to now, nearly a decade later, he's still trying to find me. He found my facebook page and attempted to contact me, but I never replied.Recently I've been thinking that if I start dating that maybe I can get \"healthy\" (also, people are starting to get on my case and ask a lot of questions, so I'd be able to put a stop to it). But that has its own challenges. Who would want to date a psycho lol. Throughout my life, I've always been able to keep up the facade that I'm normal, until now. Over the past year I've been very rash, argumentative and angry. I have even less patience for people than normal. I noticed that I've stopped smiling and laughing at people's jokes (things I always did out of habit to keep up an appearance). Generally I've been very abrasive. Mentally I've also been a bit off. It's as if, all of a sudden, I've realized that there is something majorly wrong and I need help.Childhood: it was tough, lots of things that could have screwed me up. So that's a source of concern. I also went through a very dramatic change in environment when I was in my early teens (around 12). No major physical or sexual abuse however.I can't decide if the solution here is to talk to a doctor or to just try to \"get out more\" and start building connections. I like the latter option more, but I completely lack the skills to create meaningful connections with people. Literally 100% of my actions vis-a-vis other human beings, since the age of 14, have been disingenuous. Only as an attempt to build a cover. That's why I always thought I might be a psychopath. But again, I don't meet the criteria (from what I read at least). Is this just regular depression?This, btw, is the first time I've openly admitted to having a problem. So any advice is appreciated.", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "Mirdan", "created_utc": 1554798258.0, "body": "I don't think you are a psychopath personally, I think anxiety is one of your bigger issues here. Definitely speak to a DR, and even better if you can, see a therapist. I know that sounds cliche, but being able to talk through how you feel and get professional guidance is incredibly good for the soul. The reason I feel it is anxiety based is I went through quite a few things you have been through. Wanting to hit the delete button on relationships, stick on my own, not committing to relationships romantic or otherwise. Feeling disconnected to everyone else. Hell I still get called weird, but I'm pretty hardened by it all and have a myriad of good friends. It is tough... getting out more can sometimes make it worse, and being surrounded by people doesn't necessarily mean they are -your- people.  Seeing a DR is a start. Disassociation and anxiety are mood killers, and even more so, makes you question every step of every conversation and interaction you have. I hope things go better for you bud. I'm around if you need to chat.

Some of they questions are \"Do you have thoughts or hurting yourself or other people.\"  The acceptable answer is \"never\".  The honest answer is \"sometimes\".  I have, on a lonely night grabbed a knife to see what it would be like to cut myself.  Not to try suicide or anything, just to see what it would be like.  I don't know what I expected.  Maybe just to let out anger or to see if I still feel.  I barely broke the skin, it hurt, and I have a little scratch on my arm for a week or so.   When I lie in bed, the first thing that pops into my head is how freeing the few seconds would feel jumping off the top of a high building.  Would I do it? No, but that doesn't mean the thought doesn't come up every night.  And it doesn't mean \"the call of the void\" doesn't terrify me when I'm on a balcony.  Because some part deep inside wants to feel that freedom.When driving and realizing how hopeless my life is, I sometimes think about just driving into a tree.When a stranger pulls some kind of asshole move in traffic, I want to see him roll his car.  Sometimes the feeling of road rage boils inside me and part of me doesn't care what happens.  So do I have thoughts of hurting myself or other people?  Sure.  Will I act on it? Probably not.So when I get that question I have a decision to make.If I pick \"sometimes\", the first person to say she's \"concerned\" is the socially awkward lady who takes blood pressure, struggles with how to work the printer, and offers patients bags of Doritos in the public assistance office. What the hell is she going to do to help me?  So to make my life easier, I just brush it off as a mistake.Then my psychiatrist sees it and asks about it.  If I tell him the truth, he'll say, \"oh, that's not good\" in a patronizing way and then do everything the same as he would anyway.  It'll be as helpful as when during my first visit 2 years ago I had to defend that I really am fucked up when he said, \"but you don't LOOK depressed!\"So I lie.  I lie because the truth doesn't help me.  When I'm honest to my family members, they just act like I'm being ridiculous and dramatic, and I'm the asshole for \"ending\" the conversation by saying how I truly feel.I've tried medication.  A dozen or so.  So far the only effect they seem to have is how much they limit my sexual ability or how often they cause me to lose my temper.  Yay medicine! What's the point of these stupid questionnaires? It seems like the only purpose is to make sure I won't kill myself on their watch.  Well as long I'm not going to do that, is there any reason to be honest?  Saying you have a problem seems to do nothing but cause more problems with how everyone else deals with you.So I lie to my doctors.  I lie to my family.  I'd lie to my friends if I had any.  Because people don't REALLY want to know about mental health problems.  They just want to feel like they aren't the ones who dropped the ball if something goes wrong.  So I lie to make everyone else feel better, and to stop them from making me feel worse.  But the lie doesn't help.  And I can never lie to myself.

The only friend I have is on the internet, and I sometimes feel like im a burden to him because I feel like im being too annoying. I've also come out to my parents and my mom said \"being bisexual or gay is a sin, etc, etc\" and I thought my dad was ok with it cause I about broke down while telling him (my sister already knew), but apparently he wanted to act the same as my mom. My dad also called me a failure once because I was going to fail a class, and I don't know why but it hurt me so much, it still haunts me to this day.

I don't think about other women. My sex drive is completely gone. I want her. And only her.

Hope you're all having a swell day.As the title implies, I'm a first-year college student, and I've been having an extremely rough year ever since leaving high-school. Last year and all throughout high-school, I was extremely diligent in all of my work, was extremely involved in clubs, sports, and within my community, and had a relatively good amount of friends. I was your typical straight-A, model student, and when graduation came around, I had received a substantial amount of awards and accolades for my work throughout high-school, and I had even gotten into all of the colleges that I had applied to. It was an exhilarating time for me and my family, and I was on top of the world.Though, due to the extravagant price of the college I had wanted to attend (which, mind you, was in-state), my family and I decided that the smart choice would be to go to my local community college (which I had NEVER wanted to go through since middle school and why I'd worked so hard in high-school to get into other colleges). So wanting to appease my parents and ultimately save my family from an overwhelming amount of debt they'd inevitably accumulate, I hesitantly enrolled at my local CC. Ever since then, I've had absolutely no motivation to do anything school related, and I\u2019ve completely stopped doing any extracurriculars. I got my first C in Calc 1, and this semester is not looking any better. Just got my second Chem test back (Bio major), and I got an extremely low C on it, bringing my grade in the class to an 82%. Not only this, but I've recently been getting some seriously strong emotions for people I like, which I have never felt before. Throughout my whole life I've ever only really liked three guys (two from high-school, one from college), and I constantly think about them, even though I know they'll never like me back the way that I like them. It's so bad because it distracts me from my studies, and when I think about never being able to be with them, it makes me extremely sad and I lose motivation to do anything else but think about them. I've even recently had dreams about them, which I've never experienced before in my entire life.Oh, also, I've distanced myself from all but a few of my friends from high-school. This one girl I go to school with I'm pretty sure is just using me for my car, and me and my other friends have a \"complicated\" relationship. So, right now, I honestly don't know what to do with my life. What am I going through right now? Am I depressed? My family treats \"depression\" as something that is self-inflicted and all-mental, but right now I'm not totally sure that it is. If anyone can tell me or try to tell me what is going on with me, and how I can help myself get out of this rut, I'd appreciate it.

What's worse is that I feel bad for feeling bad because I know there are millions if not billions of other people who would do anything to have the life I have right now. I get that, but I still just can't stop feeling really depressed. In fact, today at the gym I had to really try hard to hold back some tears and a couple of guys came over to ask me if I was alright. Obviously I lied and said I was. But I'm most definitely notI would really like to be married and have kids by the time I'm around 30, but being 24 right now I haven't had a single girlfriend yet. I take every opportunity to ask girls out (both in real life and online dating) and first dates usually go well. At least it does from my perspective. I usually end up kissing most of my dates and rarely get the cheek. On a few occasions we even have sex. But it never works out and I very rarely get 2nd datesI know I'm still pretty young but what really bothers me is that I've not had any success at all when most of my peers not only have steady relationships but a lot of them are also getting married. The other thing that really bothers me is that I don't want to wait for the \"perfect\" girl to come into my life because I'm not even sure what perfect looks like. I want to be able to have multiple relationships over the next 5-10 years for experience. To see what type of girl I would really get along with. I want to be in both good and bad relationships to get that perspective. If I hold out for just that one girl, how will I know she is actually the perfect one if I haven't experienced anything else. And at this rate it's going to take me 100 years, if even that, to get those relationships.I'm also really lacking intimacy in my life. Yeah I've had sex before and it's great but that's not the kind of intimacy I'm talking about. I have a lot of hobbies and interests and I'm looking for someone to share those experiences with. I never got any intimacy from my parents either growing up because we never got along (they're great people, we just have completely different outlooks on life).What really crushed me recently that's almost throwing me over the edge is a recent date I went on. This girl was literally an exact copy of me and I saw myself in her in almost every aspect. We had very similar upbringings, same personalities, same hobbies/interests, etc. I thought the date went great and we made out afterwards. She even texted me later saying \"I had a good time :)\". When I tried to set up a second date several days later, apparently I found out I got ghosted.I'm just really tired of the string of rejections over the past 5-10 years with no success at all. And if a girl who is almost identical to me rejects me, then what hope do I have with any other girls?The worst part about dating is that there's no way to get feedback on what I'm doing right or what I'm doing wrong. I have plenty of platonic female friends and they said they would date me if they're weren't in a relationship and if I wasn't like a brother to them. That doesn't help at all. Girls I go out with don't want to be honest either on why I got rejectedWhat's the point in having the rest of my life work  out if I'm always alone and have no one to share it with? Friends are nice but they're not people I can be intimate with (both physically and emotionally). I haven't had real suicidal thoughts yet because I'm always hanging on to the hope that the next date will work out, but after years of rejections I'm really starting to get close to the point of no return. And this last date was an especially big blow because everything just seemed so perfect and it still didn't work out.I haven't told anyone about this, no one even knows I'm depressed inside. I try to hide it when I'm in public or with people (it's pretty easy for me to hide/fake emotions), but when I'm by myself I'm crying a lot. I don't really expect any of you guys to fix my problem (if that's even possible) or to even read this whole thing. I guess I'm just ranting here.

I\u2019ll try to summarize my story as best I can to make it as brief as I can. 12 years ago my world was upside down when I was diagnosed with cancer. I did the chemo, surgeries, etc. and beat it. 9 months after going into remission, I relapsed. So I did stronger chemo and again I was cancer free. 2 years later, I was diagnosed with a secondary cancer in my blood and underwent more chemotherapy as well as a BMT. Due to having to having a BMT, I had a severely compromised immune system to the immunosuppression medicines that I had to take. This pretty much put me on house arrest I called it. I handled it okay for the first few months being restricted to my house, parents house or the hospital. I got a Golden Retrieved puppy to raise while I was locked in the house. Eventually, the restrictions started to affect me. I was not me anymore. There were only a few things that made me happy anymore and I started to take it out on my parents and GF of nearly 5 years. After months of being pushed to see a counselor, I finally gave in. And it was the best thing for me. After 15-20 sessions, I was back to myself. In the years that followed the BMT, I have struggled with side effects of the treatments. The chemo and immunosuppression wreaked havoc on my body. Due to this I\u2019ve struggled to maintain s consistent work schedule. My employer had been very gracious and understanding of my health situation. A few months ago, I had another flare up of gastroparesis. It\u2019s the third time in 4 years. I\u2019ve put off hip replacement surgery for the last 2 years, scheduling the surgery only to cancel it s month before due to work. I\u2019ve done the same thing with the dental work I desperately need. I\u2019m usually strong through things like this but this time I think it has finally broke me. In the last 2-3 years of dealing with these side effects, I\u2019ve become much more stressed than normal trying to balance my job and my health. I have even felt embarrassed in the office because I\u2019m the \u201csick guy.\u201d I\u2019ve let it build up inside of me for so long, this recent ailment broke me and I\u2019m very confident I\u2019m suffering from depression again. I just don\u2019t know how to handle it all anymore I guess you could say. I finally bit the bullet today and started making some calls to seek counseling. I have not been able to make an appointment yet but I told myself I\u2019m not going to sleep until I have 5 options for counseling.This is where I need help. The first time I was diagnosed with depression, I was still finishing up school and was not working. But now I am working and I don\u2019t know what to do in regards to my job. Should I disclose my depression and mental health issues to my boss and/or HR? Can they fire me for depression? Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you have any advice or input on this, please let me know. I can\u2019t tell you how much I would appreciate it.

Prior to this point in my life, work was great, happiness wasn\u2019t a thought it was just life, gf was great and I was motivated to tackle life. But after these life events occurred my motivation towards work and life quickly started to fade, my drive for women became non existent and I lost my ability to walk for more than 10 minutes with my herniated disc. Now that time has passed, life has improved a decent bit in terms of women and overall happiness... but man! I cannot motivate myself to work. I used to wake up everyday wanting to work and pursue freelance jobs. Now the days just slowly blend together and I don\u2019t feel like trying. I have no motivation to pursue new clients or new work and don\u2019t even care if I keep the ones I have (even tho deep down I know it\u2019s all I have to keep me afloat). What does this mean? Why am I not inspired to work or do stuff? Partly because I am unable to with my back but what do I not want to pursue new things? Please help!

I just don't kill my self in that time because i didn't have the courage to do it and that makes me feel even worst. Now days im in my way to recovering, i'm trying to regain all the objectives i had in the past and looking for a better life. The point is that i was doing all this recovery process alone, by my self and i feel like i has been pretty succesfull doing it because im a pretty introspective and realist person, that makes me realize many of the sources for many of the problems i have and triying to see the big picture, leaving my feelings aside so they cant interfere with the objetive truth behind my actions. Now, its not allways the case. Sometimes i feel like filtering all this emotions and thoughts it's an exhausting process, like in some point im overloaded, them i colapse and i just let all this negative feelings go trough, and this episodes are going harder and harder to going through so im afraid that in some point i will not be able to recover, lost all the progress i made and get back to being a person with no interest on life. Thats why im looking for professional help this time but i feel insecure abouth the effectiveness of this method. I dont need someone to tell me the causes of my depression, i know it and i know what i need to get out of this. Is that sometimes i cant stop the things i feel with the things i know, its like in this episodes i just dont want to be ok, like get the things i want in my life are just too much effort and is better to just dont want anything, nothing is worthy of effort, nothing is appealing anymore. I have even feel like i was a totally different person with other objectives in mind. I think a therapyst would be good to tell me if fi have some condition, if my problem is product of some malfunctioning on the chemistry of my brain but that would not be any help because here were i live we dont currently have medicaments for mental illness so, good to know but not helpfull. Im going to therapy anyways, but i would be really disappointed if this turns out to be just someone telling me things that i already know or another random person to talk about my feelings.", "top_comments": [{"author_reply": null, "score": 2, "author": "itll_be_fine", "created_utc": 1554791873.0, "body": "All therapists are different, and many practice different kinds of therapy. So if you have a bad experience with one, don't let that stop you from seeing another. Not every therapist will provide what you want.\n\nTherapists don't just tell you why you're depressed. They teach you skills and methods to deal with your depression. They show you negative thoughts and behaviors you have that are holding you back and that need to be changed. They aren't just a random person you can talk to about your feelings, they are a trained, educated professional who has the knowledge and resources to help you manage those feelings. \n\nEven if they tell you things you already know, it's helpful to hear it from someone else. There are things about us that we look past, or forget about, things that other people notice. You can ask them questions about those things and gain a new perspective. You can see how someone else views your problem, and what they think you should do. And if you disagree, you can talk to them about it. Conversations like that are helpful, it lets us feel accepted and understood, which is very important as well. \n\nIt's good that you understand your depression, and know what you want out if therapy. That makes talking with a therapist easier and more efficient. \n\nBe open to the experience. Be as honest as possible. Learn as much as you can.\n\nI wish you all the best."}, {"author_reply": null, "score": 1, "author": "slowdowns", "created_utc": 1554793363.0, "body": "What's it mean when 3 of them tell you they can't help you and not to rebook, when you always showed up and were receptive to whatever they said?

That doesn't mean you can't be helped, it mans that they don't believe they have the right skills or experience to treat you. So they turn you away so as not to waste everyone's time with ineffective treatment. \n\nIt may be that you aren't responding to their treatment. You are receptive to what they are saying, but maybe what they are saying isn't helping you. Or they don't think they are helping you, so they tell you to find someone else who can. \n\nFrom what you say, the therapists you've seen don't provide you with the skills or advice you need. And they may be able to recognize that. But these are all theories of mine, I haven't met you or your therapists so I can't say for certain.\n\nIf you continue seeking treatment, I would bring up these concerns with future therapists. Tell them that you haven't been receiving proper care, and that you want activities and other things to work on. Let them know that you need more than just discussion of your feelings. \n\nHaving tried 3 therapists and not gotten what you need is really frustrating. Perhaps look into different types of therapy; therapists with different training and backgrounds. There are many different types of therapy, art therapy, music therapy, if you can find different types, they may be of more help to you. \n\nKeep it up, you got this."}], "created_utc": 1554786985.0, "author": "HonestLuis", "upvote_ratio": 1.0}]
